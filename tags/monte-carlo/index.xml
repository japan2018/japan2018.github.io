      <description># (Postscript) I&#39;m sorry!  The results of np.random.randint and random.randint are different, It turns out that you lose at the casino. For more information: https://qiita.com/mnoda/items/a75d350e1aa432eaf4f3
I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found a way to win at the casino (in Python). .. .. This can go! AI betting on horse racing has recently been talked about at Qiita, but I tried to program it from a different angle. I&amp;rsquo;m not a &amp;ldquo;professional&amp;rdquo; in programming, but I&amp;rsquo;m scared of making it myself.</description>
