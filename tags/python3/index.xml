      <description>## Introduction-What is satellite data-   Artificial satellite data refers to data acquired by &amp;ldquo;remote sensing&amp;rdquo; using artificial satellites. Until now, satellite data required specialized tools and a large-capacity data processing platform, so the available organizations were limited to university institutions and some specialized institutions, but the spread of open source libraries and data By using the processing infrastructure cloud, an external environment has been set up in which general organizations can easily handle satellite data.</description>

      <description>#Let&#39;s explain about Othello class 2  Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about types There are blood types, right? Type A, Type B, Type O, Type AB, etc. Whether it is true or not, aside from the fact that it is &amp;ldquo;A type that is well-organized&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;B type that is selfish&amp;rdquo;, the type has its own characteristics. In programming, types are used to make such important divisions as blood types.
Until now, I have explained various things about variables, but I have not touched on types.</description>

      <description># You should learn the program by moving it and watching the movement  Anyway, the program is running and Nambo. There is also an effect that the understanding can be promoted by playing around with it, so today the source of the Othello game is a little long, but first I will release it. Let&amp;rsquo;s create this as a new PyCharom project.
Launch PyCharm and create a &amp;ldquo;New Project&amp;rdquo; from the File menu.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  It has become commonplace to fine-tune and use BERT for natural language processing tasks. It is expected that there will be more and more scenes where you want to improve the accuracy even a little when doing competitions such as Kaggle or projects where accuracy requirements are tight. Therefore, we will summarize the accuracy improvement method. Classification task is assumed as a task.
Adjust number of characters You can enter up to 512 words in the learned BERT.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  I use Qiita a lot, but this is my first post! Nice to meet you!
There are many useful articles on Python, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think many articles mention Python&amp;rsquo;s internal implementation so much, so I&amp;rsquo;m motivated to be able to link various data structure explanations with internal implementation. This time I will write about Python list.
About this article This article wrote about the Python list mechanism. However, it is impossible to write how all the methods in the list work, so mainly</description>

I can&amp;rsquo;t say that Python is easy for anyone to program, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think the super-convenient features that are so boring are known to me. Moreover, when I try to use a convenient feature, it makes no sense at all. Nana no.</description>

      <guid>https://memotut.com/try-drawing-a-map-with-python-cartopy-0.18.0-d41b7/</guid>
      <description>When drawing a map with cartopy 0.18.0 or earlier, there were problems such as the axis labels only supporting equirectangular projection and UTM projection, and the axis label format being questionable. I wrote [this article](https://qiita.com/earth06/items/f5958a89a546dce00c36) about the adjustment of the axis label, but since the adjustment function around the axis of the cartopy has been significantly strengthened, the axis is very simple. You can now write labels.  In this article, we will plot the map with adjusted axis labels using the latest features of cartopy.</description>

      <description>I will explain how to solve **A,B,(C),D problem** of **AtCoder Beginners Contest 165** with **Python3** as carefully as possible.  I am aiming to explain a solution method that satisfies the following three points, not just a solution method.
 Simple: don&amp;rsquo;t worry about extra things Easy to implement: I&amp;rsquo;m happy with fewer mistakes and bugs No time required: Paphos go up and more time can be left for D problem  5/17 C Problem was very difficult and the article was long, so I separated it into another article.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  I bought a Razz pie, thinking that I might find a new hobby indoors during lockdown. I wondered if it would be useful for experiments later if I could control the motor, so I bought a stepper motor together, so I will control it. It is interesting just to rotate it at a constant speed, but the goal was to be able to do arbitrary movements. I started from almost zero knowledge of electric and electronic circuits, but it was easy to do because various information was dropped on the net.</description>

      <description>Hi, this is [Muscle Training Clinical Engineering Engineer ken](https://twitter.com/ce_fitness_note).  This is my first post on Qiita.
I usually use C# to develop medical systems. I decided to focus on machine learning, so I started learning python.
Even though I learned about it, I went around Progate&amp;rsquo;s python course, but I will briefly summarize the differences between C# and how to write.
If you usually use C#, C++, VB and want to learn python from now on, I think that learning will be better if you know the difference between the two in advance.</description>

      <description>I would like to introduce a Python coding technique that I haven&#39;t seen before. I&#39;m sorry if it was unexpectedly major. I also want to put the sample code as much as possible and show how it is actually useful. Since it is a collection of niche technologies, it is a prerequisite that Python can be written to some extent.  #functools.partial This allows you to create a function with fixed arguments for a function.</description>

      <description>I will introduce the python grammar that you may be able to do a drooling face if you know mainly new features.  1. Assignment expression New syntax added from python3.8. It&amp;rsquo;s good to know something new. An assignment expression can be written with the syntax :=, and conditional expressions and assignment statements can be used at the same time.
For example, the following common conditional expressions

      <description># Overview  Note that I created a function that outputs the tree structure of files and directories nicely in Python, like a tree of commands.
#Conclusion
Just give the path of the directory you want to display as a tree to the following function. Since it is implemented for Mac, it is not supported when paths are not separated by slashes.
import pathlib import glob import os def tree(path, layer=0, is_last=False, indent_current=&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;): if not pathlib.</description>

      <description>Although there are some cases where regular expressions are usually needed, I have not studied it systematically, so I will organize and summarize it. The language is Python.  It&amp;rsquo;s quite long. If you read this, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t get angry even if you tweet &amp;ldquo;I fully understand Python regular expressions&amp;rdquo;.
What is a regular expression in the first place? Regular Expression is in English. This is an expression (processing) that performs various processing by specifying a specific pattern when performing special operations related to character strings.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  This article is primarily about competitive programming.
There are several ways to implement stacks and queues in Python.
 Stack -Use list (append(), pop()) -Use collections.deque (append(), pop()) Queue -Use list (append(), pop(0)) -Use collections.deque (append(), popleft()) -Use queue.Queue (put(), get())  Which of these is the best to use? This time I will investigate it focusing on the speed aspect.
#Measurement method For each data structure, elements are added and extracted 10 times, 100 times, 1000 times, 10000 times, 100000 times.</description>

      <description># how?  \zeta(2) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} (Basel Problem)
 You can use this formula to find an approximate value for $\pi$.  Calculating $\sum_{n=1}^{a}\frac{1}{n^2}$ using $1$ as an integer from 1 to $1$ $\times6$ for the answer obtained in 2.1 Calculate the square root of the answer obtained in 3.2. This value is an approximation of $\pi$.  So I implemented it in python. Code is omitted.

Scraping is basically okay, but if you are prohibited by the terms of use of the target site or if you put an excessive load on the server of the target site, you may be punished.
What is Tor It is a technology that anonymizes the connection route. Theoretically, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to determine who accessed using Tor.

I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but it seems to be popular to post with the face hidden by an icon. Is it because people without a face can see the coordination objectively?
However, the face hiding work is surprisingly troublesome, and I wish I could automate this&amp;hellip; so I implemented a program for automatic icon placement.</description>

      <description>#What is the difference between statistics and machine learning? Why can&#39;t I predict from machine learning today and make money?  Perhaps everyone wonders when they start studying machine learning. And why can&amp;rsquo;t many business companies use it for their daily work today? The question also comes up. There are various documents, but I was having trouble comprehending them, so I rearranged them myself. I&amp;rsquo;m putting together a lot of information by combining information.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  I summarized the article about using LINEBot with Django because it was a little researched and it was old.
For the time being, I will create an Omukai Bot that returns the text sent as an introduction to LINE Bot.
Here article uses SDK, but I&amp;rsquo;m a Python beginner ~~ I can&amp;rsquo;t even throw an HTTP request with Python ~~ I want to do it.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Django beginner with less than a week of Django history.</description>

      <description>This post is the 25th day of &amp;quot;Natural Language Processing Advent Calendar 2019-Qiita&amp;quot;.  siny.
In this article, I summarized the creation of a negative-positive classifier using BERT, which plays a major role in natural language processing in 2019.
#Introduction I think that knowledge about BERT has appeared in books, blogs, Qiita, etc. However, since most datasets that can be used for natural language processing are based on English, and there are not many Japanese datasets, it is quite difficult to use BERT using Japanese text.</description>

A brief overview In this article, I will explain how to analyze sentiment by natural language processing the text of the novel **&amp;ldquo;Weather Child&amp;rdquo;**!
In general, emotional analysis is to discover and quantify &amp;ldquo;emotion&amp;rdquo; contained in a sentence and judge the opinion of the sentence. This is an area of current interest because it allows us to mechanically categorize user opinions about our products and services.
On the other hand, &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it possible to use sentiment analysis in addition to reviews and reviews?</description>

      <description>It is no exaggeration to say that the modern information society is supported by cryptographic technology. Nevertheless, we are reaping the benefits without being particularly aware of cryptography. What&#39;s more, cryptography has been around for a long time, as it existed around 100 BC. In addition, Hyundai Cryptography is trying to ensure high security by making full use of advanced mathematics, and eventually it will be derived from blockchain technology.

The hardest part is reading the code, and what does this function return? Do not know at first glance what this variable contains. &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;There is no type as a document.</description>

Note: What is ASGI?:briefcase: ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is the spiritual successor to WSGI and aims to provide a standard interface between asynchronous-enabled Python web servers, frameworks, and applications. While WSGI provided the standard for synchronous Python apps, ASGI provides both asynchronous and synchronous apps with a backwards-compatible implementation of WSGI and multiple servers and application frameworks.</description>

More details There are many types of garbled patterns. Garbled characters that occur when displaying UTF8 files in SJIS, Garbled characters that occur when displaying UTF8 in EUC, Garbled characters that occur when displaying EUC in UTF8&amp;hellip; You can check what each looks like on this page (https://tools.m-bsys.com/ex/html-mojibake.php).

This time, for the same Django beginner as I am, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to write a rough guide to how to get rid of things that will bother you and make you cry. It is Server Error (500).
At this time, try to display the error content on the screen even temporarily, output a log, or notify Slack of the error content.</description>

      <description>When implementing a web application using Python in business, we decided to introduce the Clean Architecture to develop while separating the concerns for each layer.  We&amp;rsquo;ve put together a set of practices for developing testable applications, using progressive typing and Dependency Injection to share knowledge with team members.
Clean Architecture This time, since the purpose is a sample using Python, the explanation of Clean Architecture will be simple.

      <description>Recently I had the opportunity to write an orchestration layer (BFF) application in Python.  Although asyncio was introduced from Python 3.4, I/O bound processing can be handled efficiently even with a single thread, but since GIL still exists for CPU bound processing, parallel processing is possible under a single process. It is limited.
From this, it can be seen as a language characteristic that it is more suitable for handling multiple I/O bound processes than CPU bound processes.</description>

Ohm&amp;rsquo;s Law (DC) It&amp;rsquo;s one of the most important laws in electrical engineering and the first to learn.
V = IR  $V$: voltage, $I$: current, $R$: resistance The above Ohm&amp;rsquo;s law is written in Python. Set to calculate for empty parameter among $V$, $I$, and $R$.</description>

      <description>When analyzing data with python, it is common (and likely) to use a module called pandas.  In pandas, data can be stored in types such as Series and Dataframe. Series is used to store one-dimensional data, and Dataframe is used to store two-dimensional data. They are like highly functional one-dimensional arrays and two-dimensional arrays, respectively. High functionality means that each row and column can be named, and many methods are available.</description>

##Install Python3 The version of Python originally included in Amazon Linux is 2.7.12. That&amp;rsquo;s why I will install Python 3 series this time. Fortunately, Python3 is collected in YUM&amp;rsquo;s amzn-main repository.
# yum list | grep python35 python35.x86_64 3.5.1-13.7.amzn1 @amzn-main python35-devel.x86_64 3.5.1-13.7.amzn1 @amzn-main python35-libs.x86_64 3.5.1-13.7.amzn1 @amzn-main python35-pip.noarch 6.1.1-1.23.amzn1 @amzn-main python35-setuptools.noarch 12.2-1.32.amzn1 @amzn-main python35-tools.x86_64 3.5.1-13.7.amzn1 @amzn-main python35-virtualenv.</description>

      <description>Note that I took a little time to retrieve the closest value from a certain value in the list with Python.  Failure example I saw how to use numpy&amp;rsquo;s searchsorted function on the net, but this function inserts a value into the list Since it is a function that returns the index when doing, it does not necessarily return the index of the value closest to a certain value.</description>

      <title>[Python] Vocabulary assessment score distribution</title>

      <description>#Vocabulary test  On August 18, 2016, A Certain Diagnosis buzzed.
[Hashtag search #My vocabulary is](https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E7%A7%81%E3%81%AE%E8%AA%9E%E5%BD%99%E5%8A(%9B%E3%81%AF?src=hash)
This diagnosis is scored by answering the four-choice question about 50 synonyms/antagonists and tells you where you are in the distribution.
However, it is obvious that this score is not &amp;ldquo;top 0.43%&amp;rdquo; without searching for the corresponding hashtag #my vocabulary on Twitter&amp;hellip;
So I took the score distribution.
~~** In the first place, I do not say that such a diagnosis has no credibility.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned a few other languages, but I&amp;rsquo;m a newbie to Python recently. In the learning process, I picked up some of the features I was interested in compared to other languages and summarized them into 12 items (+ bonus 1).
Each item is almost independent, so you can skip and read it. (Qiita has a table of contents function, so skipping it is easy!)
The operation is confirmed by the Python 3.</description>

      <title>[Python] [python] A note about __debug__</title>
      <link>https://memotut.com/python-a-note-about-__debug__-fc446/</link>

      <guid>https://memotut.com/python-a-note-about-__debug__-fc446/</guid>
      <description>#Note   It&amp;rsquo;s just a memo #__debug__ This is one built-in constant. If you add -O during python execution, it becomes False, otherwise it becomes True. (This is capital letter O, not zero)  def debug_print(s): if not __debug__: print(s) If you make it like this,
$ python -c&#39;(__import__)(&amp;quot;debug_print&amp;quot;).debug_print(__debug__)&#39; $ python -O -c&#39;(__import__)(&amp;quot;debug_print&amp;quot;).debug_print(__debug__)&#39; False Like, is printed only when the -O option is added.</description>
