      <description>## Introduction  Django A continuation of 4 for beginners to create simple apps. The purpose is to remove complicated things and troublesome things as much as possible, create a simplified web application, and learn the mechanism of Django. Only understand what is connected and how it moves around the backend. Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) as you go, and score if you move safely. Last time I rewrote Class-based-view into Function-view and compared how the two compare to track how Django works.</description>

      <description># Purpose  Data collection is a pain. I thought that I would like to analyze boat racing in the future, so as a practice of data collection Odds table of official boat racing site.
Overview  I can only think of a convenient language = python for scraping, so I use python3.7. Python 3.7 is called beatutiful soup ~~ It seems a little erotic ~~ It seems that the library with the name is convenient for scraping By using the beautifulsoup css selector, you can specify the location of the table without deciphering the html one by one!</description>

#44 ABC056-C
Thoughts The sum of non-negative integers up to i is $\frac{1}{2}n(n+1)$}}. This sum becomes $X$ when $\frac{1}{2}n(n+1)=X$, and when solving for $n$, $n=\frac{-1\pm{ It will be \sqrt{8X+1}}}{2}$. If you add the ceil symbol to the solution of this equation, it becomes $\lceil \frac{-1\pm{\sqrt{8X+1}}}{2} \rceil$. This is the answer.
import math x = int(input()) f = (-1+math.sqrt(8*x+1)) / 2 print(math.</description>

      <description>### Introduction  Last time I have ABC today so I have only one question.
#41 Problem
Thoughts It&amp;rsquo;s a long-standing problem. When I tried to solve this time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand why I was having a difficult time. Since the range of the solution is small, check all with for. I have placed a flag to check if the M conditions are met.
n, m = map(int,input().split()) sc = [list(map(int,input().</description>

      <description># My background  Amazon? Ah, you know, you know, a mail order app. Not long ago, knowledge about Amazon was that much. Of course, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know AWS.
I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed as an information undergraduate student. 
However, as a 3rd year university student, I was introduced to the lab and learned about AWS. In addition, I am addicted to the topic &amp;ldquo;Atsuhiko Nakata&amp;rsquo;s YouTube University&amp;rdquo;, which is a hot topic in this street.</description>
