      <description>#Purpose   There was an interesting campaign I was wondering how much a person has exposed their profile inadvertently  #Environment or data
Analysis API There is not enough knowledge to do the analysis from scratch by yourself, so this time NTT Communications has published COTOHA API I used.
##raw data This time I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of using the chat log as a base. In Japan, LINE is the mainstream when it comes to chat, but LINE has a chat log export function.</description>

      <description>#TL;DR  By using the COTOHA API, we have proposed a poem that is close to what you want to convey from the Hyakunin Isshu. As a gateway to more &amp;ldquo;elegant&amp;rdquo; communication, you can bridge between engineers and non-engineers. (May be)
