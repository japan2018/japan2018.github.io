      <description>#Introduction  In distance learning (metric learning) using deep learning, similarities (and dissimilarities) between images are used by using Contrastive Loss and Triplet Loss.) Is widely used, but it is also known that it is difficult to combine and select learning data, and learning itself is difficult in many cases. For that reason, various improvements and ideas have been proposed so far. However, recently, metric learning, which can learn based on the Softmax function as if it is a general class classification task without the difficulty of selecting learning data like this, has been attracting attention.</description>
