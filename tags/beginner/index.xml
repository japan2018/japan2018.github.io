      <description>#1.Introduction  ##(1. Purpose If you want to do machine learning, anyone can use scikit-learn etc. to implement it relatively easily. However, in order to achieve results at work or to improve your level, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand the background, but I got this result&amp;rdquo; I think it&amp;rsquo;s clearly weak.
This time, we will focus on &amp;ldquo;correlation&amp;rdquo;**.
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about decorrelation, why do you do it?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;How do you use it?</description>

      <description>## Introduction-What is satellite data-   Artificial satellite data refers to data acquired by &amp;ldquo;remote sensing&amp;rdquo; using artificial satellites. Until now, satellite data required specialized tools and a large-capacity data processing platform, so the available organizations were limited to university institutions and some specialized institutions, but the spread of open source libraries and data By using the processing infrastructure cloud, an external environment has been set up in which general organizations can easily handle satellite data.</description>

So, if you make a note of this properly, it will be useful for later, so I decided to post it to qiita after reading the line by line.</description>

I can&amp;rsquo;t say that Python is easy for anyone to program, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think the super-convenient features that are so boring are known to me. Moreover, when I try to use a convenient feature, it makes no sense at all. Nana no.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Human communication includes not only language but also many non-verbal information such as facial expressions and gestures. When analyzing and interpreting human behavior mechanically and programmatically, more information can be obtained by adding meaning to such non-verbal information. These technologies are being researched and developed in various fields such as image processing, natural language processing, and voice recognition, and are expected to be applied in many fields such as marketing and robot interaction systems.</description>

      <description>## Following the trend of the world ~ About programming ~  Recently, &amp;ldquo;programming&amp;rdquo; has come to the forefront without even saying. Until a while ago (2010-2015), programming was something that engineers in the science field worked on, and it was unfamiliar to so-called non-mathematical people, such as those used by PC experts. However, if you look around the world, IT companies such as GAFA are listed in Top 10 in the world market capitalization ranking.</description>
