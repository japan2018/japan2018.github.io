      <description>I will summarize the procedure to create a development environment of Django + Apache on Ubuntu 18.04 of Windows 10 WSL  Procedure Allow apache2 to access python via mod_wsgi. Also, we will make VScode usable as a remote IDE that can be used with WSL.
 Install anaconda3 Install django Create a django project and migrate Install apache2 Install mod_wsgi Add to apache2 configuration file Enable vscode  Since WSL cannot use systemctl, the operation of apache changes a little, when using anaconda, you need to change the reference setting by yourself unless you install mod_wsgi with pip, it is hard to understand the setting of apache2.</description>

      <description>I tried #VSCode&#39;s Jupyter notebook.  There was an article of VS Code Jupyter notebook in the magazine, so I tried it. I made a Jupyter notebook experience very easily, so I will make a note of my footsteps.
Assumption  Tried on Mac. Homebrew has python installed as python3. When I put python3, pip3 is also included  ###python3
$ which python3 /usr/local/bin/python3 $python3 --version Python 3.7.5 ###pip3
$ which pip3 /usr/local/bin/pip3 $ pip3 --version pip 19.</description>
