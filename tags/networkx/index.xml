      <description>## Introduction  The route map and the graph network are compatible, and we will touch on the shortest path problem that anyone can think of when trying to think about something on the route map.
Convert the railway route map into a simple graph problem, and use the Dijkstra method to find the shortest route. The Python library NetworkX has a built-in Dijkstra method, so this time we will use it.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Created by a Pokemon researcher, We will help you analyze the results of the Pokemon Uniqueness Questionnaire.
This time, this article is about the case where the questionnaire respondents performed ``visualization of the play tendency of 18 Pokemon games&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; with networkx library.

      <description># 0. How do you draw a graph?  In order to draw in 2D, it is necessary to give proper coordinates to each vertex, but the graph only has information on vertices and edges. How do you place the vertices? ?
In this article, I will explain an algorithm Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm that arranges graphs in a nice way. With Python, you can easily use the library called networkx. However, it is too easy to be frustrated, so I will check the mechanism while following the GitHub implementation of networkx.</description>

      <description>This article is the 22nd day article of [NTT Communications Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/nttcom).  Yesterday was @kanatakita&amp;rsquo;s article, &amp;ldquo;A story I want to beat the conference necessary to release the application&amp;rdquo; (https://qiita.com/kanatakita/items/a68c6e7758524422ecb0).
#Introduction Hi, my name is yuki uchida, and I belong to the SkyWay team of NTT Communications. This article is the second series of &amp;ldquo;I want to visualize&amp;rdquo; after Hands-on to visualize my tweet while understanding BERT.
When I was hitting Spotify&amp;rsquo;s API privately, I thought that I could make interesting visualizations related to the recommendation system, which is my personal interest range, so I am writing this article.</description>
