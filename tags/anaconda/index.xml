      <description>After launching the Mac terminal,  The familiar (base) characters at the Anaconda prompt start. By the way, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Anaconda lately.
(base)username:~$ Cause Since the setting that automatically enables the virtual environment built with Anaconda may be effective, I ran the following command to check.
$ conda config --show | grep auto_activate_base Now that we have a True returned, we know we need to change the settings.
auto_activate_base: True Environment ãƒ»MacOS Catalina 10.</description>

      <description># Miniconda  A lightweight version of Anaconda. While Anaconda includes many libraries and IDEs, Miniconda focuses on conda, Python, and the minimum required libraries.
What is good Lightweight compared to Anaconda At the time of installation, since various Anaconda is included, it will be about several GB. In that respect Miniconda contains only the minimum required, so it will be several hundred MB.
conda can be used conda is a tool for managing Python packages and versioning Python itself.</description>

      <description>#Overview  Hello. A new employee of an IT company. Here, I described a sine wave prediction regression model learning program as a sample using Pytorch which is an open source machine learning library. (It&amp;rsquo;s not a time series forecast&amp;hellip; I also want to do a time series forecast.)
By moving chainer to pytorch, I was late, but I wrote it because I am trying to catch up this time. It also describes what I felt the difference.</description>

      <description># First, install Anaconda   Download the distribution of python3.7 from Anaconda. When you run the downloaded one, a GUI installer will appear, but if you are not particular about it, it will stick with the default and complete the installation  If you use PyCharm or Jupyter, pass path to the anaconda interpreter individually with them, so this is the end story. But you should get an error even if you try python -v with cmd.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Do you guys do it?
Machine learning
He has been touted for the last three years as the third AI boom. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, deep learning I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying silently these days, but it&amp;rsquo;s kind of difficult&amp;hellip;
This time, let&amp;rsquo;s leave that area and create a machine learning environment quickly. It&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly easy to make. (I think there are many reference articles, but I also use them as notes for myself)</description>
