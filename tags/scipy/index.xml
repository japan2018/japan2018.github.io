      <description>#Introduction  This is a completely personal memo at that time because I needed to convert the rotation in the left-handed coordinate system (often used in computer vision and Unity) and the rotation in the right-handed coordinate system (often used in robots and physics). Since many libraries are created in the right-handed coordinate system, I have summarized how to convert at that time.

      <title>[Python] [Python] Article that enables high-speed sparse matrix calculation</title>

      <description>#Introduction  **A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements of the matrix are 0. It is used in a wide range of fields such as numerical calculation, machine learning, and graph theory (I think). Since most of the matrix is 0, if you devise to ignore 0, you can perform matrix calculation at high speed. For example, if you use a large-scale sparse matrix (nearly 90% is 0) (1 million rows x 1 million columns) and only use non-zero parts, the calculation time will be about 1/10 and the calculation can be completed quickly.</description>

      <description>#1.First of all  The number of new corona pneumonia (Covid-19) that occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 is increasing in Japan. Understanding how infectious diseases such as influenza, AIDS, and SARS spread through human populations through the process of confirming the effects of health policies such as setting vaccinations and isolation of infected persons. Is also important. In the previous article, I explained the SIR model, but I will introduce the SEIR model that considers the latency of infectious diseases.</description>

      <description>#1. At the beginning  The number of people infected with the new coronavirus (Convid-19) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 in Japan is increasing. Understanding how wrestling infectious diseases such as influenza, AIDS, and SARS spread in human populations is essential to confirm the effects of health policies such as setting vaccinations and isolating infected people. Is also important. Here, we will introduce the SIR model, which is the basis of the infectious disease mathematical prediction model, and the process of calculating this model in Python.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  The Poisson distribution that always appears when studying statistics, but the formula for the probability distribution did not come into my mind at all, so I tried to understand it carefully from the derivation of the probability distribution. I also draw in Python to grab the image.

      <description>This article is the 22nd day article of [Furukawa Laboratory Advent Calendar](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/flab).  I am an OB of Furukawa Laboratory, but I was invited by a student to participate. Thank you.
#Introduction This time, I would like to explain the sparse matrix and its representation format while also describing the implementation by scipy.sparse. This article is intended for people who have become accustomed to numpy to some extent, but haven&amp;rsquo;t dealt with sparse matrix-related&amp;hellip; I just want to know a little about what it is!</description>

      <title>[Python] How to sample from any probability density function in Python</title>
      <link>https://memotut.com/how-to-sample-from-any-probability-density-function-in-python-93626/</link>

      <description>~~MCMC should be done! Onegacious without the tsukkomi  As you know, many probability density functions are predefined in scipy, and by using them, you can easily perform sampling and plotting of probability density functions.
For example,
stats.norm.rvs(loc=50, scale=20, size=1000) Then you can get 1000 samples from a normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation 20, and
x = np.linspace(0, 100, 100) px = stats.norm.pdf(x, loc=50, scale=20) plt.plot(x, px) Then we can also plot the normal distribution at $0&amp;lt;x&amp;lt;100$.</description>

      <description>I want to run a #Python program at high speed!  ** &amp;ldquo;If you can calculate 10 times faster, you can make 10 times more failures&amp;rdquo; ** If you think so, everyone should think that it would be good to be able to calculate quickly.
As for the title, Numba, it is a module that can accelerate the calculation on Python by using JIT (just-in-time) compiler. This article is a memorandum of past excellent articles about Numba.</description>
