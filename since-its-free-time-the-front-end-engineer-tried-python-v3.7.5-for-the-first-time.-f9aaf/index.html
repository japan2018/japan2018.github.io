<pre><code>#Greeting
</code></pre>
<p>Hello.
My name is Steve.T and I am a front-end engineer.
I usually do Vue.js, React, and Angular.
I wrote Python because I wanted to study something because it was completely full remote and I was free.
Backend knowledge is stopped in PHP, I can not write Ruby or Python, it was a little &hellip; and I heard that Python is standard equipment for information processing tests, so I have to do this finally. I put out my hand.</p>
<p>By the way, writing on Qiita is also the first post.</p>
<h2 id="lightly-introduce-yourself">Lightly introduce yourself</h2>
<p>Engineer history: About 8 years
At first I wrote about PHP, VB.net, VBA for about 4 years.
I thought jQuery was interesting because I started writing JavaScript four years ago.
I did an AngularJS project 3 years ago, and this is amazing! Then I became a modern (?) Front-end engineer.
I&rsquo;ve been freelance for about two years.</p>
<p>Since Web API started to spread, I was mainly doing front-end, so writing APIs on the back end was only a matter for PHP, PHP is also available, and Lambda etc. I&rsquo;ve never written an API in.
Impression that I tried Python.</p>
<p>#Surprised</p>
<p>Insanely easy coding!
Easy!
You don&rsquo;t have to remember any extra things, it&rsquo;s as simple as you can without having to think about the basics, is this a modern language?
I didn&rsquo;t get used to the fact that the indentation was a block, but in a moment I said, &ldquo;This is good.&rdquo;
I thought that I didn&rsquo;t feel frustrated by writing JavaScript such as the lack of semicolons or lack of parentheses, and the lack of parentheses in Python.</p>
<p>Below is the point that I was scared.</p>
<h2 id="for-is-simple">for is simple</h2>
<p>How do you write forEach? When I thought about it, only for came out, and I thought that this was a troublesome person&hellip; For was all contained in for.
Too simple and scared.</p>
<h2 id="functional-atmosphere-is-similar-to-php">Functional atmosphere is similar to PHP</h2>
<p>I usually only write js, and since it&rsquo;s only methods and objects, I put it in () for a long time.
Similar to PHP, I thought that it might be easier for experienced people to enter Python.
I was scared because len() was too count().</p>
<p>By the way, I didn&rsquo;t need to type variables, and I felt PHP in that respect.
It&rsquo;s easy to write quickly, but it&rsquo;s very dangerous if you don&rsquo;t set the rules for large-scale development.</p>
<h2 id="easy-to-install-and-run">Easy to install and run</h2>
<p>There was no hell **PHP&hellip;Windows&hellip;XAMPP&hellip;Apache&hellip;
It can be installed in a moment, what if you have an editor, you can execute it with F5 one shot and see it in the result console, it&rsquo;s too easy to catch up.
It&rsquo;s easy to put anything with pip.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-tried">What I tried</h3>
<p>I tried scraping for a while, writing and reading in DynamoDB with Lambda and trying it as an API, but it proceeded at a tremendous speed.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>**Python is good. Became. **
I loved how easy it was to write, how easy it was to stick to it, and how quickly it was developed.
I wonder if Python will be the main language of Lambda in the future.</p>
<p>I was scared by scraping and sleeping It took about 100 hours if I turned it for a long time and it was extra time, so it is the first post.
I have a lot of knowledge about Vue.js and things I want to write, so I will post again.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do Python!</p>
