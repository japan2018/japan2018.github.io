      <description>I made it because I wanted to monitor changes in a certain site. Currently I am monitoring my self-introduction sentence, but I can use it on other sites by changing the url and class_name.  The page data is acquired every 20 seconds, and it is displayed whether the data is different from the previous acquisition.

When you&amp;rsquo;re working with data, you inevitably come into contact with Excel. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t use it for yourself, it will be needed by clients and colleagues. Excel excels in spreadsheets with small datasets.

I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed as an information undergraduate student. 
However, as a 3rd year university student, I was introduced to the lab and learned about AWS. In addition, I am addicted to the topic &amp;ldquo;Atsuhiko Nakata&amp;rsquo;s YouTube University&amp;rdquo;, which is a hot topic in this street.</description>
