<pre><code># Goals for this article
</code></pre>
<p>Each person has different timing to meet data analysis. Depending on when you met each other, your position in data analysis will change. What is data analysis for me, and how do you intend to get involved?
I hope that while reading the example of myself, who is just a science student, the readers will also have the opportunity to ask themselves.</p>
<p>#Overview of the article
・Goal of this article
・Until ordinary science students become data analysis personnel
・What is data analysis for me?
・What kind of career do you have in the future?</p>
<h1 id="until-ordinary-science-students-become-data-analysis-personnel">Until ordinary science students become data analysis personnel</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m an ordinary science student who doesn&rsquo;t have any special skills. It seems to be identified, but it is a common &ldquo;biological student who is not interested in biology&rdquo; who fell to the University of Tokyo and enrolled in the University of Tokyo in the second half. I don&rsquo;t have any experience of attending a number of competitions, competitive professionals, or other contests. I have advanced to college, but I was not passionate about it.
This may be true of any science system, but I have the opportunity to learn programming in class. In my case, I used to analyze the three-dimensional structure of proteins with python and the nucleotide sequence information of DNA with python and R. The data analysis I touched on here for the first time made me want to learn more about it for the first time, so I started my career.
Actually, this start was only about half a year ago and it&rsquo;s been recent, but I valued the speed of learning and did the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy technical books such as python, R, SQL etc.</li>
<li>Enter the &ldquo;Data Learning Guild&rdquo; online salon where people involved in data analysis gather.</li>
<li>Apply for a short-term intern with data analysis as the business content</li>
<li>Work as a long-term intern whose main business is data analysis.
Currently, application companies are conducting access analysis, UI/UX improvement proposals through analysis, marketing measure proposals, execution, and effect verification. Although it is a short experience period of more than half a year, it is now enough for one person to make analysis, verification, measure proposal and outlook presentation from hypothesis planning.
Regarding learning, I have been working with the primary goal of changing the environment and working as an intern to improve efficiency. In order to work on the internship, study the deliverable-based and aim to hire an intern at the earliest. I am a summer intern for 5 days, but I decided to study for the first time in 2 months. So far, I have been promoting the application business by introducing <a href="https://twitter.com/greengreenmidor">Mr. Murakami</a>,theownerof<a href="https://data-learning.com/guild">DataLearningGuild</a> It has been adopted in the field of data analysis / marketer at a venture company. I am very grateful for being able to evaluate and recommend myself in terms of learning speed and motivation, for which I had only five years of short-term internship analysis experience. In terms of changing the environment, joining the Data Learning Guild was big. The place where you can actually connect with many owners such as Murakami, who is an independent owner using data analysis, as well as many engineers and consultants involved in data analysis, is a great place for me to ask questions and collect information. was. I&rsquo;m still taking care of you there.</li>
</ul>
<p>#What is data analysis for me?
Since I was little, I have been looking forward to solving people&rsquo;s worries and worries and realizing the hopes of others. Of course, I had my own dream, but I couldn&rsquo;t get enough of it. While there were people who talked about various dreams for the future, I quickly gave up my dream of becoming a professional baseball player and began to do what I could do and what seemed to be interesting things around me. There are people with various dreams and strong passions in the world. However, many of them have not been realized. It is difficult and difficult to put dreams into reality, to take concrete action steps, and to solve the problems faced at that time.
While improving the power of problem solving through data analysis, I realized the dream and desire as a powerful &ldquo;No. 2&rdquo; and &ldquo;right arm&rdquo; of those who have such intense dreams and desires. I&rsquo;ve come to be fascinated by doing it.
For me, data analysis is a means of problem solving. Furthermore, I think it is the core of the ability to realize the ideal.</p>
<p>In other words, for me, data analysis is a weapon for realizing dreams, ideals, and desires.</p>
<h1 id="what-kind-of-career-do-you-have-in-the-future">What kind of career do you have in the future?</h1>
<p>As I said earlier, &ldquo;Data analysis is a weapon for realizing dreams, ideals, and desires.&rdquo;
As a data scientist, I have little experience, skill, and knowledge, and as a weapon, my level is still low.
The types of weapons are roughly classified</p>
<ul>
<li>Data comprehension ability (statistics/domain knowledge)</li>
<li>Data processing ability (programming skill)</li>
<li>Data interpretation ability (logical thinking ability)</li>
<li>Communication ability (presentation ability, hearing ability, negotiation ability, etc.)
I think
At the university, I would like to improve the data comprehension ability, which weapon to polish. Especially statistics. Therefore, my most recent expected career is to major in statistics at graduate school. The reason for studying statistics at the university is that other abilities are acquired through output opportunities such as practical work. I hear in various places that &ldquo;it is better to have a theoretical understanding such as mathematical understanding in a university after becoming a member of society.&rdquo; Therefore, I will hone my other skills in the field where I am currently working, including activities at the internship.
I also plan to study abroad in the United States and become accustomed to English while participating in an internship overseas as a data scientist. My experience there will broaden my options and perspectives when choosing a country or company to work for.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, I hope to be the COO who is committed to realizing the dream of the CEO I wanted to work with. However, I don&rsquo;t know when I can dream for my long life. At that time, I would like to fulfill my dream as CEO with my ability as a COO.</p>
<p>#Summary
The story is a little off from data analysis, but for me data analysis is a weapon of realization that makes my dream come true.
For some people, data analysis is a dream itself that opens up new territories and AI. Therefore, the idea of data analysis here is only for me.</p>
<p>In addition, the envisioned career can only be thought of based on my knowledge at the moment, so I will continue to study, listen to the stories of various people, and make improvements steadily. The assumed career in this sentence is ambiguous, but I hope to keep a record of my activity in future articles and twitter.</p>
<p>Data analysis is so attractive in itself that many people start studying. If some of you are studying and are not sure what you want to do with data analysis, please think it over once and it will help you in your future study policy.
Thank you for reading to the end.</p>
