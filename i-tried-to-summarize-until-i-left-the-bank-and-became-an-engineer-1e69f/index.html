<pre><code>#Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>Nice to meet you. My name is Shunta.
I retired from a bank where I worked for about two years as a new graduate at the end of April 2019, attended a programming school for half a year from May, and started working as a data analyst from November.
For me, 2019 was a year of great change in my life, so I decided to write an article about what I think now as a review of the year and my readiness for the future.</p>
<p>Overview
I described why I left the bank, became an engineer, and what the future holds.</p>
<p>We hope this article will be a reference for some worried young people.</p>
<p>#Self before entering the bank
Before writing the reason why I left the bank, I would like to briefly introduce myself when I entered the bank.
From the time I was born until I got a job, I was a person who grew up in THE Japan education.
I was thinking about life as if I could be happy if I could study, enter a good high school, enter a good university, enter a good company.
I didn&rsquo;t enter the university because I wanted to study, so I was a crap student who was just mahjong in college life.
Having lived such a life, I was very lost when I was looking for a job. I have nothing to do&hellip;
Still, I managed to think about myself and decided to work for a bank for the following reasons.
・Because I like to work with numbers, is it interesting to study financial matters? Will it be useful for something in the future?
・Isn&rsquo;t it difficult to quit because the turnover rate is high? Is it relatively advantageous for changing jobs?
・High income from a world perspective?</p>
<p>Finally? The fact that &ldquo;is attached&rdquo; indicates that I was thinking about that much (laughs).
If you think about it now, I think that there are various other options for this reason, but I was not doing job hunting until the last minute or my horizons were still narrow, so I finally managed to work. I decided to get a job with the feeling that it would be.</p>
<p>#What I thought when I entered the bank
First of all, when I entered the bank, my thoughts did not fit&hellip;
Let me just say one thing, nobody disliked me at the bank where I was working,
I have no intention of denying them (although some people weren&rsquo;t good at that&hellip; lol).
Of course, there were many seniors I could respect.
However, the idea of an organization called a bank did not fit at all, and I thought that I would definitely quit somewhere in the first few months. For reference, what I think was stressful when I looked back is as follows. I don&rsquo;t think bankers are suitable for people who are stressed by this.
・Poor relationship and poor ventilation
・Too much unproductive work.
・I&rsquo;m not excited.
・I am only following numbers for my own convenience
However, I didn&rsquo;t have anything I wanted to do, so I was a bank that I had been working on, and after continuing to work for a while, I decided to quit and continued to work. I think there are).</p>
<p>#Reasons for leaving the bank and becoming an engineer
It was around January 2019 that my determination quickly solidified.
Originally, I dreamed of making a fortune and bought a virtual currency (my XEM was also stolen due to the commotion of the coin check that made a noise in the world lol).
In 2018, I made the common mistake of seeing a painful eye after starting BTC-FX and being a beginner&rsquo;s rack.
I hate losing and vowed to win at all costs, and as I learned about the ideas of people who live in various ways through the internet, I became keenly aware of the breadth of the world.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it was people called botter who changed my mind. They used a self-made automated bot to give images of bombs every day. There are a lot of people on Twitter who give me images of bombs (it can be easily processed), so what attracted me was the act of ticking the intellectual curiosity of trading with an automatic trading bot.
This was what made me interested in programming (which is why I chose python).
Then, as I researched programming, I realized that the world of IT had a lot of dreams and seemed interesting, so I decided to change jobs.</p>
<h1 id="half-a-year-at-a-programming-school">Half a year at a programming school</h1>
<p>Since I was working in Sendai and it was difficult to change jobs, I had no programming knowledge, so I decided to change jobs at a programming school.</p>
<p>I studied at a school called .Pro for half a year.
The school is held once a week on Saturday, and there were two presentations in half a year.
The good thing about going to school was that I was able to actually make things and listen to the talented people who work in the IT industry.</p>
<p>Looking briefly back at half a year, I first studied hard about the basic syntax of python. I want to say&hellip;
For the first two months, I spent my time studying with one hand, focusing on the trades I personally wanted to do. I will omit this because it will take a long time to talk about this, but I think that these two months have been a good opportunity to reconsider my view of life.</p>
<p>After that, I did the following:
Creating an automatic trading bot.
create linebot
Creating a memo app with Django
Machine learning study
Create price prediction model in machine learning</p>
<p>While studying like this, I like mathematics, so I started to want to study more and decided to become a data scientist.</p>
<p>#About the company you joined
From November, I joined a company that mainly dispatches personnel for analysis work.
Since I had been training for two months, I still have no impressions about the work, but I can say that one thing I can say is that the people around me are very motivated.</p>
<p>#Future outlook
Since mid-December, I have been taking a job-learning deep learning course, which is an E-certification course.
My immediate goal is to study machine learning and deep learning and become a freelance person.
There are many things I want to do, so I would like to do my best to make them come true.
At first there were some uncertainties, but now I am more excited about what my life will be like.</p>
<h1 id="at-the-end">At the end</h1>
<p>Not only bankers, there are many people who have doubts about the current situation or are not satisfied with the current situation.
I hope this article is one way to rethink those people&rsquo;s lives.
I think people have different values and environments, but if you have something you want to do or want to change the current situation, I would like you to take the plunge and take action.</p>
<p>It was a long and long sentence, but I think it was a good opportunity to organize my thoughts again.
I will continue to write articles regularly, including the meaning of the output, so I hope you will read it!</p>
