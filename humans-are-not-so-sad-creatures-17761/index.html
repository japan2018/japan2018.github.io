<pre><code>With the birth of the Internet, the world has changed dramatically. Now with just one smartphone, you can instantly do various things such as research, shopping, communication, entertainment consumption, and information dissemination.
</code></pre>
<p>As efficiency went on, people&rsquo;s tasks continued to diminish, and even ** began to disappear. **The everyday life is spreading, in which people act like the information recommended by AI and like the posts that everyone likes.</p>
<p>What was born in that flow was <strong>violence of words on SNS</strong>. It seems that there are many people who give out malicious words to their opinions and mistakes made by others from a non-related standpoint like lightning.</p>
<h1 id="has-the-internet-become-such-a-sad-place">Has the Internet become such a sad place?</h1>
<p>It is said that Twitter, which is highly anonymous and open, is full of such people among SNS**. The Internet, which was revolutionary in that everyone was openly connected, has now become such a sad place.</p>
<p>However, people who are so aggressive in the workplace and in friendships do not see it that much. Even if the malicious intent is exposed only on Twitter, will it change so much?</p>
<p>Perhaps, **There are so few people who receive such aggressive replies, but the words are too stimulating, and they are just being taken into account? ** I was always swayed with such an expectation.</p>
<p>So, this time, in order to know how many malicious tweets directed to someone are posted, I will investigate the feelings of tweets that fly around on Twitter. **For the survey, I decided to use <a href="https://api.ce-cotoha.com/contents/index.html">COTOHA API</a> of NTT Communications.</p>
<p>*This is a survey of original trends. If you are looking for accurate data, you should not see it.</p>
<p>#API sentiment analysis</p>
<p>First, check the information that can be acquired by the sentiment analysis API. If you pass a text to this API, such data will be returned.</p>
<p>** ① emotional label **: Positive/negative/neutral
<strong>② emotional score</strong>: Reliability of ① (0.0 to 1.0)
<strong>③Emotional phrase</strong>: The phrase and its information that are the basis of the judgment result of ①</p>
<p>As an example, let&rsquo;s pass the sentence &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too interesting. (Excerpts from the surveyed tweets)</p>

</code></pre></div><p>The result is like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>① emotion label: positive
② emotional score: 0.5743490485050234
③ Emotional phrases: Too interesting: P (Positive), Highest: P (Positive)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that emotions are judged according to the phrases used in the text. **The more positive a phrase is, the more positive it is, and the negative one is negative. **</p>
<p>And, **malicious tweets that obviously hurt others are sorted to the basic negative side. ** So, I&rsquo;ll classify emotions first.</p>
<h1 id="survey-target">Survey target</h1>
<p>For each category, we will sample 400 replies on Twitter (within about 3 months) for several survey targets and examine the proportion of each emotion (negative/positive/neutral).</p>
<p>** ① Reply to the general public **
** ② Reply to corporate account **
<strong>③ Reply to celebrity</strong></p>
<p>*Duplicate tweets with exactly the same content, such as those posted by bot, are excluded.</p>
<ul>
<li>In view of API restrictions, the number of samplings is limited to 400, which is likely to ensure reliability.
*Only those that have been replied directly, not mentions, are targeted.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="before-that">before that…</h1>
<p>Before we move on to the main subject, let&rsquo;s take a look at the proportion of sentiment of &ldquo;Tweets not directed to anyone&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;reply to people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The target could have been anything, but for the time being, some tweets containing <strong>regional or community words</strong> that seem to have a small image bias. I also took 400 of these.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/280076/c4e20f91-1e02-08c6-b425-121c49c07245.png" alt="no1.png">
All are similar numbers.
<strong>Around 30% positive, around 25% negative, around 45% neutral</strong>. There are few data to say standard, but I got a rough image that people usually spell sentences with this kind of balance.</p>
<p>In addition, I will also look into <strong>Recent Current Matters</strong>. How much bias is caused by the material.
<img width="581" alt="Screenshot 2020-02-28 17.22.35.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/280076/6a7c3ed7-f4f2-34fe-ea89-8565eecdeb94.png">
Despite some changes from a while ago, ** there is no big bias. ** Viruses tend to be negative as a target, but on the contrary it seems that there were many tweets that tried to spread accurate information and measures.</p>
<p>By the way, looking at the data so far, I get the impression that ** although the positive/negative degree may change somewhat depending on the target, there is no big difference **. But what about the main subject, tweets to people?</p>
<h1 id="survey-results">Survey results</h1>
<h2 id="-reply-to-the-general-public">① Reply to the general public</h2>
<p>First of all, I examined a properly selected ** general account (1,000 to 5,000 followers) ** for a few people. (Hide the user name)
<img width="604" alt=" Screenshot 2020-02-28 17.22.47.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/280076/0c593360-78d3-a255-b9e5-f1e29d137266.png">
Compared to the previous results, positive and neutral values fluctuate greatly among people. And **Negative ratios are almost the same, which is a big drop. **This can also be thought of as &ldquo;when people speak to people, they prefer positive words over random tweets&rdquo;. **</p>
<p>Even so, it&rsquo;s uncomfortable to have 14% of negative replies for all properly selected ordinary people. So, when I checked the contents that were negatively judged, there was absolutely nothing &ldquo;with malicious intent&rdquo;. **</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>a phrase has a negative meaning (as a result, it is judged as negative), but there are sentences that are positive or neutral</strong>. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Donmai. I&rsquo;m not good at dancing too.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sentence is positive encouragement as a whole, but it was judged as negative because it contains the negative phrase &ldquo;I am not good at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In summary, ** Even if the ordinary person is speaking normally, a phrase of about 15% or less has a negative meaning, but it seems that it is unlikely to be maliciously **. (I think it would be different if something was really criticized)</p>
<h2 id="-reply-to-company-account">② Reply to company account</h2>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s look at <strong>famous corporate accounts</strong> running Twitter as well.
<img width="574" alt="Screenshots 2020-02-28 17.23.10.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/280076/5829b757-de46-32ac-2cc5-10de6a893cba.png">
Here, **Negative judgments have decreased. ** Moreover, all three companies have a stable low value of 10% or less. There seem to be few phrases that have a more negative meaning than conversations with the general public.</p>
<p>Even though only one person handles Twitter, I can feel the background such as <strong>Because I carry a company, it is difficult to make emotional and exciting tweets…</strong>.</p>
<p>And, as I did before, when I checked the contents of the reply, I found that there was <em>no malicious thing</em>. It seems that the corporate accounts are not too malicious.</p>
<h2 id="-reply-to-celebrity">③ Reply to celebrity</h2>
<p>So far, the peaceful results have continued, but at the end I will select 20 celebrities with more than 100,000 followers ** and investigate the feeling of reply to them. (Number of followers in parentheses)
<img width="702" alt="Screenshot 2020-02-28 17.23.31.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/280076/f34fefcb-5f5e-7969-d1cd-6b72d8cc8e63.png">
Compared to the results so far, <strong>The overall variation is stronger</strong> (By the way, the variation does not seem to be related to the number of followers, and it seems to depend on that person&rsquo;s individuality).</p>
<p>And when I took a quick look at the contents of the reply that was judged to be negative, **I thought that this was malicious&hellip; **This is the number of replies that deny the person&rsquo;s personality and arranged in order (malicious number).</p>

</table>
<p>This is the most thought-provoking result so far. **I thought that the following tendencies could be seen.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are many celebrities who do not receive malicious replies</li>
<li>The number of malicious replies seems to be correlated with the amount of increase of negative phrases over a certain percentage (from around 10% mid-range?)</li>
<li>If there is blame, there will be a sudden increase in malicious replies, but the negative percentage will not increase, and there will be a lot of fan support.</li>
<li>When there is a celebration, it is overwhelmingly positive (Congratulations to Marriage Imoto)</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know why, but Kuro-chan is said to be horribly awful</li>
</ul>
<p>#Summary &amp; Postscript
I am afraid that it is only hypothetical content from the relationship of the amount of data, but if you summarize the results of this time</p>
<p>**&ldquo;Basically, people speak to others in a positive, non-malicious way, and malicious replies are mostly directed to some limited celebrity, and in most cases There is only one per 100 replies.</p>
<p>I think it will be like that. So overall, it can be said that <strong>&ldquo;humans are not such a malicious and sad creature&rdquo;</strong>. &hellip;I can do a proper happy ending, but after all I was looking at various reply contents, I thought that it was something different.</p>
<p>‥
I was wondering if I should write it, but I will excerpt the phrase contained in the negative reply that I found this time. **I&rsquo;m sad when I think that such bad words are passed from person to person. **
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/280076/e362632d-9337-530a-c522-b1af702e9243.png" alt="Tweet.png">
Also, some celebrities will get more than 1000 comments a day, including mentions. **Even if there is 1 in 100 malicious ones, if this is skipped over 10 times a day, it will be too painful. **</p>
<p>‥
However, while I felt such a thing, I strongly felt the power of positive words. **The following is a partial excerpt from such a realistic phrase.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/280076/b4cff889-cc44-5036-c7ae-23247da60112.png" alt="Tweet2.png">
I don&rsquo;t think there are so many happy words to meet face-to-face even if I usually live. Just as there are malicious intentions born anonymously, there is also a wonderful feeling of appreciation and praise that I feel strongly because it is an anonymous world. **</p>
<p>‥
For example, if a week later the world is ruined, no one will be able to put a malicious word for someone on their smartphone for the rest of their lives. **But life is a series of such precious times. If it is **, I would like to find and select people and environments that can exchange even a few positive words.</p>
<p>It is said that the open internet is moving towards closed. But I feel like an open world will be required in some other way. At that time, I&rsquo;m really looking forward to seeing how we can create an Internet world where everyone can connect with each other comfortably.</p>
