      <description>## Thing you want to do  It seems that a suspicious person appears at night at the entrance of the apartment where I live, so I installed a web camera on the entrance door and made a system to analyze and record with Raspberry Pi. The specifications are as follows.
 Display the recorded video and time on the screen If someone comes in front of the entrance, record a still image in jpeg format Embed the shooting time in the recorded still image Allow some false positives  *By the way, we have already obtained permission to install the camera.</description>
