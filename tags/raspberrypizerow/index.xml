      <description>Make a washing and drying timer using # RaspberryPi  Introduction (purpose of production)  Because I work for a company, I am often absent during the day, and I can not take in the laundry when it rains. For this reason, laundry is basically dried indoors. However, since the clothes drying room is not sunny and the drying does not proceed as expected in winter, the timing of taking in may be missed, and the laundry accumulates in a snow dharma fashion, creating a vicious cycle.</description>
