      <description>I found an interesting problem, so I tried solving it.  Problem  There are $N$ cards, and the $i$th card has $A_i$ written on it. T picks out $M$ from this at the same time. How many pairs of numbers are there on the removed card? However, it does not distinguish pairs such as $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ whose order is changed. For example, consider the case where $N=5$, $M=2$, $\{A\}=\{1,2,2,3,4\}$.</description>
