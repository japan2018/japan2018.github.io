      <description>#Introduction  I bought a Razz pie, thinking that I might find a new hobby indoors during lockdown. I wondered if it would be useful for experiments later if I could control the motor, so I bought a stepper motor together, so I will control it. It is interesting just to rotate it at a constant speed, but the goal was to be able to do arbitrary movements. I started from almost zero knowledge of electric and electronic circuits, but it was easy to do because various information was dropped on the net.</description>
