      <description>I found an interesting problem, so I tried solving it.  Problem  There are $N$ cards, and the $i$th card has $A_i$ written on it. T picks out $M$ from this at the same time. How many pairs of numbers are there on the removed card? However, it does not distinguish pairs such as $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ whose order is changed. For example, consider the case where $N=5$, $M=2$, $\{A\}=\{1,2,2,3,4\}$.</description>

      <description>## bit full search means 2^n full searches  Example ARC061: Many formulas
Given a string S consisting only of numbers &amp;gt;1 and 9 inclusive. Within this string, you can put +&#39;s in several places between these characters. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to enter any. However, + should not be consecutive. All strings that can be done in this way can be regarded as mathematical expressions, and the sum can be calculated.</description>
