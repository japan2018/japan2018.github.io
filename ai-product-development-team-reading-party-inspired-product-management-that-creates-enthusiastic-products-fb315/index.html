<pre><code>In this post, I will introduce the management method and contents of the reading event held by the &quot;AI Product Development Team&quot; that I lead.
</code></pre>
<p>The books targeted at this reading party are
** [INSPIRED Product management that creates enthusiastic products] **
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0814STTHV/">https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0814STTHV/</a></p>
<p>is.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/191401/d37dabde-9e76-6ef6-ab84-57f4a6d56199.png" alt="book.PNG"></p>
<p>In Japanese, it is translated as &ldquo;Product Management that creates enthusiasm products,&rdquo; but in English
<strong>How to Create Tech Products Customers Love</strong>
is.</p>
<p><strong>How to make a loved product</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Product Management</strong> is the theme.
The original work is a classic product management book with a 370 review rating of 4.6 on Amazon.com.</p>
<p>The Japanese version is also very good and the translation is polite.</p>
<p>Even in Japan, if product management and product managers (PdM) become more standardized, I think that this book will get more attention.</p>
<p>Members of the &ldquo;AI product development team&rdquo; that I lead are strong in technology (especially AI and deep learning),</p>
<p>For members,</p>
<p>** Create products that customers love and use even if they pay for it! **</p>
<p>And because we&rsquo;re SIer&rsquo;s AI product development team,</p>
<p>** If there is such a product, I would definitely like to introduce it to that customer! **</p>
<p>A product that our sales employees love and want to introduce to customers. .. ..</p>
<p>To create such a product, raise awareness of product management,
We chose this book so that we could acquire the knowledge for that purpose.</p>
<p>In this article,</p>
<p>● How to run a reading party
● Impressions
● Where the members liked</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to introduce_______</p>
<h2 id="how-to-manage-a-reading-party">How to manage a reading party</h2>
<h4 id="holding-time">Holding time</h4>
<p>Late April to mid-May 2020.
Due to the influence of COVID-19, it was held during the time when everyone was teleworking from home.</p>
<h4 id="holding-cycle">Holding cycle</h4>
<p>It was held once a week and every Thursday from 13:00 to 14:00 for an hour.
It was held 5 times in total.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-divide-5-times">How to divide 5 times</h4>
<p>1st: chap1～chap8
The second: chap9-chap21
The third: chap22-chap37
The fourth: chap38-chap57
The fifth: chap58-chap67</p>
<p>About 50 to 100 pages per week was the range.</p>
<h4 id="number-of-participating-members">Number of participating members</h4>
<p>This time, 6 people (including myself) will be able to do so due to their time.</p>
<h4 id="preparation-by-the-day">Preparation by the day</h4>
<p>Members of the reading group will read the next event range and select two sections that they like.</p>
<p>And in the file shared by everyone,
*** Two favorite parts and their words**
And
***Why did you choose that part? How do you relate to your business? Why I liked it**</p>
<p>I had you write. It&rsquo;s easy to say about 2-3 lines.</p>
<h4 id="operation-on-the-day">Operation on the day</h4>
<p>The reading party was held online at Teams.</p>
<p>For the first time, I will carry out the operation on the day,
From the second time onward, we asked two people, who would like to become leaders, to alternate weekly.</p>
<p>The operator shares the “2 favorite parts and the reason” that everyone wrote down.</p>
<p>The person who wrote the contents displayed on the screen,</p>
<p>Read out what you liked and why you gave it
We asked him to talk about his/her past work, future thoughts, and what he/she usually thinks.</p>
<p>Although it is a few lines in the memo, it is like feeling more detailed.</p>
<p>And other participants added their own thoughts and experiences to the place and the reasons given,
Inflate the story</p>
<p>It is the flow.</p>
<p>Doing this for 5 people, I just talked a little at the end and it was like an hour.</p>
<h2 id="impressions-implemented">Impressions implemented</h2>
<p>I think that each participating member has their own thoughts, but I</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Everybody was interested in different parts, and the different parts came from their different projects and development experiences, and it was fun to hear various opinions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the contrary, the important points that many members liked are the points where the non-verbalized information was clearly expressed, such as &ldquo;What do we all want to value?&rdquo; Became</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was a reading event in which not only the people who actually do things close to the leaders and PdM, but also the members who follow them participated. By learning while sharing product management, I think that the members have been able to smoothly follow the leaders and that the leaders can smoothly lead the development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reading party was just after completing a large development project, so I was able to deepen my reflection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Product management is completely impossible with just one book reading party,
I think it was good that everyone, including myself, went one step ahead.</p>
<p>What do you say···</p>
<p>Although we are still not at the level of product management goals,
It is a feeling that everyone can take the same step toward the goal.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-places-that-members-like">Introducing places that members like</h2>
<p>Lastly, I will introduce the points picked up by all the members.
But,
6 people × 5 times × 2 places</p>
<p>This is an excerpt from a total of 60 locations.</p>
<p>**chap.1_ What is behind a great product**
“There are ideas that are my belief and the core of this book.
Behind every great product is a product development team that combines technology and design,
It means that there are people who solve the real problems of customers in a way that suits the business needs.
The person doesn&rsquo;t usually appear on the table, but he is constantly working.
These people usually have the title of product manager. ”</p>
<p><strong>chap.4_Growth companies</strong>
“Technological infrastructure tailored to the original product needs often reaches capacity limits.
Every time you meet an engineer, you hear the word &ldquo;technical debt.&rdquo; ”</p>
<p><strong>chap.5_Growth company</strong>
“Leaders often irritate their inability to come up with innovative ideas from product development teams.
And we often run into acquisitions or set up an independent &ldquo;innovation center&rdquo;,
Trying to create new business in a protected environment.
But that rarely leads to the much-needed innovation of leaders.”</p>
<p><strong>chap.6_5 root cause of product development failure</strong>
“The same is true for the role of design. It&rsquo;s too late to incorporate the true value of design into the process.
And most of what is done is what we call the &ldquo;pig on lipstick&rdquo; model.
It&rsquo;s already damaged, but I&rsquo;m just trying to paint the junk.
UX designers know this is wrong, but try to make it look as good and consistent as possible. ”</p>
<p>**chap.7_ Beyond Lean and Agile**
“A good development team usually tests a number of product ideas each week to get the desired results.
10 to 20 or more per week. &quot;</p>
<p><strong>chap.7_Comprehensive Principle 3</strong>
“It&rsquo;s not about implementing features, it&rsquo;s about solving problems.”</p>
<p>**chap.8_ Continuous product discovery and market launch**
“The product development team is always working on two things in parallel.
The first is to discover the products that need to be made. This is basically done by product managers and designers every day.
Second, engineers bring high quality products to market. ”</p>
<p>**chap.9_ Where the development team is**
“If you&rsquo;ve been a member of a single product development team, you know what I mean.
Even so, if you know how to work in a product development team, you&rsquo;ll find that there is a unique energy created when the teams sit together, have lunch together, and build a personal relationship with each other. Let&rsquo;s ”</p>
<p><strong>chap.10_Product Manager and Product Owner</strong>
&ldquo;It is essential that a product manager is a product owner at the same time in a product company.
If we now split the role into two people, some common problems will arise.
Most typically, development teams lose the ability to innovate and constantly create new value for their business and customers.
Especially in a product company, a product manager can be judged by a good product owner if the product manager has additional responsibility. &quot;</p>
<p><strong>chap.10_the second half of the beginning</strong>
“Truth be told, the product manager should be one of the most talented people in the company.
If your product manager doesn&rsquo;t have a high degree of technical knowledge, business skills, trust relationships with key executives, deep customer knowledge, passion for products, and respect for your product development team, you will definitely fail. ”</p>
<p>**Chap.23_ Roadmap alternative (P. 137, P.138)**
“Product development teams must have a business context.
That means knowing exactly where your company is heading and understanding how your team wants to contribute to big goals.
It is important for all product development teams to understand how their work contributes to a larger organization and what companies want their teams to focus on right now. ”</p>
<p>**chapter24_ Product Vision and Product Strategy**
“Hopefully, product vision will be one of the most effective recruiting tools and will also motivate team members to come to work every day.
A talented engineer is drawn to an exciting vision.
I want to work on something meaningful. ”</p>
<p><strong>chap.25_Product vision principles_Part 2</strong>
“Love the problem, not the solution”</p>
<p><strong>chap.25_Product Vision Principles_Part 5</strong>
“Product vision must shake people&rsquo;s hearts”</p>
<p><strong>chap.33_Principle of Product Discovery_Part 6</strong>
“The validity of the idea must be proved by the actual user or customer.
One of the most common traps in product development is believing that you can predict how customers will react to your product.
It may be a customer survey or a decision we make based on experience, but as we all know today, we must always validate the idea with the actual user or customer.
This needs to be done before spending the time and money to develop a genuine product. Not after. ”</p>
<p><strong>chap.34_Overview of discovery techniques_Finding framing techniques</strong>
“What business goals do we need to focus on, what specific problems we are trying to solve for our customers, what users or customers we are trying to solve, and what we have to succeed. Consensus needs to be formed.
These should be directly linked to the product development team&rsquo;s Objectives and Key results. ”</p>
<p>**chap46_ Feasibility Prototype Techniques**“In my experience, it usually takes a day or two to build a single feasible feasibility prototype. However, there are new key technologies such as machine learning approaches. If you&rsquo;re considering, building a feasibility prototype is likely to take longer to build.”</p>
<p>**COLUMN_ role of analysis**
“In my experience, it&rsquo;s the reliance on outsiders&rsquo; opinions that has produced the worst results of past product development.
The higher the status of the person who speaks in the organization, the more important the opinion is.
Today, in the spirit of data being better than opinion, we only have opinions when we run tests, collect data, and use that data to support our decisions.
Although data is not everything and we are not slaves of data, the best product development teams today have countless examples of making decisions based on information from test results. ”</p>
<p>**chap.61_Managing Stakeholders_&ldquo;Strategy for Success&rdquo;**
&ldquo;Usually, companies say that at their meetings, product managers give PowerPoint presentations about what they&rsquo;re trying to make.
There are two serious (possibly career-impairing) problems with this.
First, using presentations to test business viability is an infamous and terrible way. The reason is too vague.
&hellip;
On the other hand, a high fidelity user prototype is ideal. ”</p>
<p><strong>chap.64_Good Product Development Team/Bad Product Development Team</strong>
“A good development team gets inspiration and product ideas from their vision and goals, seeing how customers are struggling and the data they generate by using their products. Analyzing, constantly trying to apply new technologies to solve real problems.
Bad development teams collect requests from sales departments and customers. &quot;</p>
<p><strong>chap.64_Good Product Development Team/Bad Product Development Team</strong>
“A good development team will instrument their products and make adjustments based on the data to see how their products are used.
Bad development teams feel that analysis and reporting is fine, but not necessary. ”</p>
<p>**chap.65_ The biggest reason why innovation is lost**
“Thanks to us, our customers are always unsatisfied.
Customers say they are happy, and even when they&rsquo;re doing well, they&rsquo;re dissatisfied.
Even if they aren&rsquo;t aware, customers want something better.
That is why we are driven by the desire to please our customers and create new ones for our customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>**chap.66_ The biggest reason for losing speed**
“The absence of a long-lived development team in the same place.
If the development team is distributed in several places and, worse, outsources engineering, it will drastically reduce the opportunity for innovation and slow down their work significantly.”</p>
<p>**chap.67_ Creating a strong product development culture**
“In any case, what I or your development team wants to do is review themselves in terms of innovation and execution, and where you want to go as a team or a company. Ask yourself if you think you need it.”</p>
