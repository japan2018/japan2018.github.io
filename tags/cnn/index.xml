      <description>#Introduction  I am currently a M2 student majoring in CS. I usually write machine learning code in PyTorch. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to write for the time being. PyTorch is said to be &amp;ldquo;Define by Run&amp;rdquo;**, and what is good at the same time when the calculation graph and data are sent is that it is easy to debug because you can check the calculation results on the way. As a PyTorch believer, I need to write code in TensorFlow this time, so I will keep a memo so that I don&amp;rsquo;t forget the know-how at that time.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  I am building my own model and always ask &amp;ldquo;What is the feature quantity of the input?&amp;rdquo; before connecting to the fully connected layer. If you often type print(model), you can understand the structure of the model, but you can not confirm up to the size of FeatureMap. So, the convenient one is torchsummary.
Who is #torchsummary?
Simply put, you can check the size of the feature map.</description>
