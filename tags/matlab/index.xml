      <description>Hello.  watawatavoltage. In this article, I would like to write about the world of control engineering books. This article is a type of article that is updated as needed, rather than being posted in the completed state. &amp;ldquo;Introduction&amp;rdquo; explains why we write such articles. If you write a book that you would like to introduce in the comment section, it will be reflected at any time. Thank you.
#Introduction Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t everyone have this kind of experience?</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Feedback control has been used to “control” everything from home appliances to industrial equipment. A device that performs this control is called a controller, and various design methods have been considered. This time, I would like to introduce a relatively new approach called &amp;ldquo;data-driven controller design method&amp;rdquo;.
I will leave the theoretical part to the paper and write it focusing on the use. So, I&amp;rsquo;d like to explain it while mixing the code of MATLAB and Python.</description>
