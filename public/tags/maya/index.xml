      <description>Nice to meet you all. The annual [Maya Advent Calender 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/maya) season has come. This is the article on the 19th day. In this article, I&#39;ll introduce a technique in which a specific object in Python has information other than the code content and that information is used in a different process to make it work. In this way, operating programming one level above, that is, programming the program itself is called **metaprogramming**.</description>

      <description>This article is the 7th day article of [**Maya Advent Calender 2019**](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/Maya).  When you create a tool for modeling in Maya, you may get the vertex position of the selected object. However, in a model with a large number of vertices, acquiring all vertex positions with MEL or cmds will be slow and will hinder modeling work. OpenMaya is often introduced as a method of increasing the processing speed, but for me it was a high threshold and I was wondering if there is a way to increase the processing speed with cmds.</description>

Overall flow Stop Maya screen drawing. ↓ Cause heavy processing. ↓ Restart Maya screen drawing and check the result.
It will be the flow.</description>
