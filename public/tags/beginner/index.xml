      <description>#1.Introduction  ##(1. Purpose If you want to do machine learning, anyone can use scikit-learn etc. to implement it relatively easily. However, in order to achieve results at work or to improve your level, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand the background, but I got this result&amp;rdquo; I think it&amp;rsquo;s clearly weak.
This time, we will focus on &amp;ldquo;correlation&amp;rdquo;**.
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about decorrelation, why do you do it?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;How do you use it?</description>

What is object-oriented programming? &amp;ldquo;Object&amp;rdquo; is a direct translation of an object. In other words, we try to program as we make things.
Things should have features or parts and movements. The kind of thing is called &amp;ldquo;class&amp;rdquo;, each thing is called &amp;ldquo;instance&amp;rdquo;, and the behavior of thing is called &amp;ldquo;method&amp;rdquo;.</description>
