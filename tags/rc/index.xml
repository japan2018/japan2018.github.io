      <description>#Introduction  The elements that make up a self-driving car in the real world are vehicle position estimation, object recognition, action judgment, and vehicle body control. It is possible to implement all four of these elements on the basis of radio control, but it is not easy to easily estimate the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s position, and this time the target is low-speed driving, so there is almost no need for body control. Therefore, this time, I would like to use an ultrasonic distance sensor to recognize an object in front of me and make a simple action decision to avoid it with a radio-controlled robot car that operates automatically.</description>
