      <title>[Python] How to build Python and Jupyter execution environment with VS Code</title>

      <description>I have summarized how to build Python and Jupyter execution environment with VS Code. I use Anaconda.  Also, I think that many people who analyze data with Python use Jupyter notebook and Jupyter Lab from their browsers. VS Code is also recommended for such people.
Also, this article is part of the article How to create a Python package using VS Code.
We will proceed on the assumption that Anaconda has been downloaded.</description>

      <description>#Background  When I made a Python environment with Anaconda + VS Code, I was troubled because the latest setting method did not come out, so I will publish my notes for those who will do it now. It seems that there was a VS Code specification change around 2017. Be careful when reading old commentary.

      <description># First of all  This article is from the 7th day of the DMM WEBCAMP Advent Calendar. This time it&amp;rsquo;s a super introduction, so I created it for those who have never tried machine learning but want to start **.
The purpose is to get a rough idea of machine learning and try to implement a basic simple perceptron for the time being, so I&amp;rsquo;ve written a lot about the explanation of machine learning etc.</description>

      <title>[Python] About package management with conda and pip</title>

      <description>[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is, in a word, a library of scientific computations etc. attached from the beginning in addition to Python itself. In addition, it has been devised to simplify package management and deployment, and comes with a package management command called conda.  About conda and pip The Python world has been around for quite some time with its own package management tools, which used to be EasyInstall, and later to use pip.</description>

      <description>When building the Python environment, I went through various articles saying &amp;quot;Authentication proxy settings, coexistence environment, and execution confirmation are all necessary&amp;quot;, so I think that it would be nice to put them all together.  #Introduction
Content The contents introduced in this article are as follows. Please skip the authentication proxy and coexistence environment construction if necessary.

      <description>#Introduction  Until now, we have been doing deep learning by running Tensorflow on the back end of Keras. If you just do machine learning in Python, you can use Keras as before, but there are applications where you want to use models and weights learned in Python in C++. Actually, it would be nice to use a model trained with Keras, but it seems easier to code directly with Tensorflow which also has a C++ API, so I will try to attack from there.</description>

      <description>It is a supplement of [python environment construction final version](http://qiita.com/y__sama/items/5b62d31cb7e6ed50f02c).  20180312 Addendum It seems that conda activate was adopted in conda 4.4.0 released with 2017-12-20. conda/CHANGELOG.md It seems that source activate is not obsolete at the moment, but conda activate is recommended.
Since docker has become proficient recently (I do not feel stress even in a windows environment through a proxy), the need for sandwiching pyenv has decreased, and I am also moving to docker-anaconda, but for reference.</description>

      <description>Chainer now depends on Cython, h5py since 1.5. The installation method on Windows is described in [2nd day article (Install Chainer 1.5.0 on Windows)](http://qiita.com/icoxfog417/items/ca1521f9d62183cea234) I would like to add some supplements so that you can easily use proper Chainer on Windows.  This content may contain errors. We will update as soon as we notice. Operation reports are welcome. Thank you for your comment
