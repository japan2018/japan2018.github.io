      <description>When drawing a map with cartopy 0.18.0 or earlier, there were problems such as the axis labels only supporting equirectangular projection and UTM projection, and the axis label format being questionable. I wrote [this article](https://qiita.com/earth06/items/f5958a89a546dce00c36) about the adjustment of the axis label, but since the adjustment function around the axis of the cartopy has been significantly strengthened, the axis is very simple. You can now write labels.  In this article, we will plot the map with adjusted axis labels using the latest features of cartopy.</description>
