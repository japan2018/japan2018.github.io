      <description>A library called [numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) can speed up Python code relatively easily.  Hopefully you can speed it up by writing from numba import jit and writing @jit in the line before the function you want to speed up.
As a mechanism, numba seems to get the virtual machine code of Python, compile it into LLVM IR, and make it native code using LLVM. At the first execution, the compile process runs, so it will be slightly slower, but if it is a heavy process, numba may be faster from the viewpoint of compile time.</description>
