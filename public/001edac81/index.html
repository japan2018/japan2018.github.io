<h1 id="step-1-get-an-overview-of-ai-and-machine-learning">[Step 1] Get an overview of AI and machine learning</h1>
<p>After reading the following two books, you will become familiar with AI, machine learning, and deep learning at the business person level, not at the tea room level.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4040800206/">Artificial intelligence is beyond humans or beyond deep learning

<p>This is an introductory book on AI and machine learning for everyone, including business people, IT engineers, and managers.
Recommended for the first book to get a sense of the whole &ldquo;What is AI?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What is machine learning?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What is deep learning?&rdquo;.
This book is easy to read even for those who have no prior knowledge. It&rsquo;s very easy to read and easy to read.
The history of AI up to now and expectations for future development are explained, and it is an interesting book to read.
By the way, there is a manga version, so you can enter from here (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4797392541/">Understanding with manga! What artificial intelligence AI brings to humans</a>) ..</p>

<p>Basic explanations of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning, background and history of artificial intelligence, and where to introduce it as a project are summarized in an easy-to-understand manner.
You can get an outline of the technology called AI.
The contents that you should know in order to utilize artificial intelligence in business are summarized, and difficult formulas and programs do not appear, so it is easy to read.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="step-2-know-the-examples-of-ai-and-machine-learning">[Step 2] Know the examples of AI and machine learning</h1>
<p>After reading the following books, you can learn concrete application examples of AI, machine learning, and deep learning.
By the way, a deep learning example of our company (ISID) and Sojitz&rsquo;s object detection of cultured tuna is also explained.</p>

<p>This is a collection of case studies of deep learning that explains the business cases of 35 companies in Japan that utilize deep learning.
In each case, it summarizes &ldquo;what was the problem?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How did you use deep learning to solve the problem?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What kind of point did you have a hard time?&rdquo;
This book is recommended for those who want to learn how to use deep learning in business, and for those who have decided to actually use deep learning in business.</p>

<h1 id="step-3-get-an-overview-of-the-g-test">[Step 3] Get an overview of the G test</h1>
<p>The following books are the official texts of the Deep Learning Association.
The basic knowledge of AI, machine learning, and deep learning in the exam is explained.
In addition, at the end of the chapter, there are examples of questions that are given in the same format as the exam.</p>

<p>Although it is not my personal favorite approach, since it is a qualification test, it is necessary to become accustomed to the test format.</p>
<p>It is also recommended that you check the “G-test mock test” on the net, receive something that looks good, and become familiar with the test format.</p>
