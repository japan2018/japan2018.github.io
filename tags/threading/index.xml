      <description>## Introduction  TouchDesigner (TD) can execute python script, If a process such as HTTP communication takes a long time, it will be hardened until the process is completed. At this time, the timeline of the whole TD also stops and the drawing is not updated, so In order to prevent it, I decided to communicate asynchronously.
If you just want to get the value asynchronously, you may use node etc.</description>

      <description>Program &amp;quot;Because I can&#39;t stop...&amp;quot;  &amp;ldquo;Stop me&amp;rdquo;
This article is the 7th day of N High School Advent Calendar 2019. I am currently in the second year of my second year (there were various things when I moved to another school), and I attend a school course. N High School is very grateful to have my own project in programming time as long as I finish the required tasks.</description>
