<pre><code>## What is Deep Learning for ENGINEER
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that this article is current as of January 2020.
Currently, the following official qualifications are available to prove AI skills in Japan.</p>
<ul>
<li>JDLA Deep Learning for GENERAL (G test)</li>
<li>JDLA Deep Learning for ENGINEER (E qualification)</li>
</ul>
<p>is.</p>
<p>Positioned as a test, the G test asks general education about AI-related technology.
E-qualification is an exam that understands the theory of AI-related technology and asks the skills to implement AI.
I understand.
Please refer to the website of <a href="https://www.jdla.org">Japan Deep Learning Association (JDLA)</a> for the details or the exact definition.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-take-the-e-qualification-and-jdla-certification-program">How to take the E qualification and JDLA certification program</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I would like to focus on the E qualification from now on.
We have two opportunities to take the E qualification test twice a year, in February and August.
However, in order to take the E qualification, it is necessary to take the JDLA certification program and obtain the qualification for the examination, which is a high hurdle both in terms of skill and money. This test itself is a selective test, so it is not a test that requires practical ability.
Therefore, if you have the courage to pay for the certification program and make an effort to complete the certification program, I think that the path to acquiring the E qualification can reach about 80%.</p>
<h2 id="flow-of-examination-for-e-qualification">Flow of examination for E qualification</h2>
<p>Since the E qualification requires a qualification to take the exam, we will introduce the process up to the exam.</p>
<ol>
<li>Participate in certification program briefings. (No need if already decided)</li>
<li>Decide which certification program to take.</li>
<li>Apply for the certification program. (Need courage to pay)</li>
<li>Take courses in the certification program.</li>
<li>**Pass the assignments given in the certification program course. ** (Knowledge of Python required)</li>
<li>**Pass the basic verification test within the certification program. **</li>
<li>** Submit your own product assignment within the certification program. **</li>
<li>** Pass the completion exam in the certification program. ** (Question format is optional, test time is 180 minutes)</li>
<li>Apply for this exam.</li>
<li>Take the exam. (Question format is selectable, test time is 120 minutes)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bold section</strong> is the part that must be achieved within the certification program.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="case-study">Case Study</h2>
<p>In my case, I took the certification program of <a href="https://avilen.co.jp">AVILEN</a>, so I will explain using it as an example.
We use AVILEN as an example here, but please look for a certification program that suits you.</p>
<h3 id="1-attend-the-certification-program-briefing">1. Attend the certification program briefing.</h3>
<p>Again, in order to take the E qualification you must take the JDLA certification program and get a certificate.
Currently, it seems that there are 12 types of accreditation programs approved by JDLA.
(There were 6 species as of June 2019.)
I learned about AVILEN&rsquo;s information session from the guide from <a href="https://techplay.jp">TECH PLAY</a>. The information session itself was free.
In the information about the briefing, there was a description like 100,000 yen and tens of thousands of yen, so I thought that I might need a participation fee for the briefing, but I do not think so. was.</p>
<h3 id="2-decide-which-certification-program-to-take">2. Decide which certification program to take.</h3>
<p>Participate in the briefing session and determine the following.</p>
<p>-How much is it?
-Which is better, classroom attendance or online lessons?
-Isn&rsquo;t the frequency of the course too high?
-Is it possible for you to respond to your learning support style immediately?
-Isn&rsquo;t there a schedule for the completion exam after all courses?</p>
<h4 id="amount-of-money">Amount of money</h4>
<p>AVILEN costs 136,000 yen if the required part is online.
The optional basic course is 100,000 yen.
The basic course was a style in which a link to a video of a past classroom lesson was sent to me and I used to study by myself.</p>
<h4 id="go-to-the-classroom-online">Go to the classroom? online?</h4>
<p>I think it is better to go to the classroom even if you pay a little difference if you can go.
Since I lived in a rural area, I had no choice but online courses.</p>
<h4 id="course-frequency">Course frequency</h4>
<p>I had this exam at the end of August.
The certification program has courses in June and July, and I took the course in July. There was a class every Sunday from July 7th (Sun) to August 11th (Sun) (6 times in total), and it was necessary to submit assignments for that class. The last lesson was on August 11th (Sunday), so the deadline for submitting all assignments was practically August 13th (Tuesday).
If the course starts in June, I have more time for one month, so I think that was better.</p>
<h4 id="learning-support">Learning support</h4>
<p>It was a style of Q&amp;A support in Slack. Although I was able to answer the question accurately, I was slightly dissatisfied with the point of immediacy.
In that respect, I think there is an advantage in going to the classroom.</p>
<h4 id="schedule-until-completion-examination">Schedule until completion examination</h4>
<p>The deadline for the completion examination was 23:59:59 on Wednesday, August 14th.
Like the above, there was no day since the last course, so I took the test at the last minute.</p>
<h3 id="3-apply-for-the-certification-program">3. Apply for the certification program.</h3>
<p>You just have to be brave and pay.
I paid 236,000 yen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Optional basic course: 100,000 yen</li>
<li>Required course online: 136,000 yen</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-take-the-certification-program-course">4. Take the certification program course.</h3>
<p>I think that you will take the course once a week.
At AVILEN, one course lasted 4 hours. Depending on the number of times, it may not be completed in 4 hours, but it may be extended by about 30 minutes, and in the latter half of the lecture materials, it may be quite a rush.
Those who took the course in the classroom seemed to be asking questions after the course, so I think the end time was even later.</p>
<h3 id="5-pass-the-assignments-given-in-the-certification-program-course">5. Pass the assignments given in the certification program course.</h3>
<p>A programming task will be given in each lesson. You will be asked to re-submit until you get the right move.
In the case of AVILEN, 6 assignments for all 6 courses were assigned.
The programming language was all Python.</p>
<h3 id="6-pass-the-basic-verification-test-in-the-certification-program">6. Pass the basic verification test in the certification program.</h3>
<p>The subjects for the basic ability confirmation test are:</p>
<p>-Python basics
-Machine learning basics
-Information theory</p>
<ul>
<li>linear algebra</li>
<li>statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>is.
You can take the exam online at home.
Although the question format is a selection type and there is no time limit for the exam, I think it was strict that the passing criteria was 80% or more. (I&rsquo;m sorry, I remember it.)
You will receive a video link from each of the past lectures, so please take a look at it and study for yourself.
It is necessary to pass the test of each subject after self-study and before taking the final exam.
Nothing more than what was explained in the course was given, so I was able to clear it unexpectedly and smoothly.
However, information theory entropy or such a story came out, and there was almost no prerequisite knowledge, so I struggled.
Linear algebra and statistics have the same level of high school to college as a 1st and 2nd year student, but the tricky problems like the entrance examination are not given.
It&rsquo;s just a confirmation of the basics, so if you look at the course properly it will be pretty much.</p>
<h3 id="7-submit-your-own-product-assignment-within-the-certification-program">7. Submit your own product assignment within the certification program.</h3>
<p>Create some software using a neural network.
I modified the handwriting recognition of &ldquo;Deep Learning from scratch&rdquo; and created a handwriting recognition program for 26 letters of the alphabet.
Some of the other students were creating other-dimensional products such as stock price forecasting using LSTM.</p>
<h3 id="8-pass-the-completion-exam-in-the-certification-program">8. Pass the completion exam in the certification program.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Weekly course assignments</li>
<li>Self-made product issue</li>
<li>Basic strength confirmation test</li>
</ul>
<p>If you pass all of these, you will be able to take the completion test.
The format is a multiple choice and the test time is 180 minutes. You can take the exam online at home.
There were 6 courses in the certification program, but 1 course = 1 subject, and the test subject was allocated, and the examination time for one subject was 30 minutes. (30 minutes x 6 subjects = 180 minutes)
It is necessary to take 30 minutes x 6 subjects in a row, and it is physically tough. My butt became sore after taking the test.
In addition, more than 60% of correct answers are required for each subject, which is an extreme example, but even if the maximum of 5 subjects is less than 60% for 1 subject, you will be rejected.
You can only retake the final exam once, so if possible, you should have enough time to take the first exam one week before the deadline. Even if you do not pass the first exam, you will have time to study again.</p>
<h3 id="9-apply-for-the-e-qualification-test">9. Apply for the E qualification test.</h3>
<p>If you pass the completion examination, the application code will be sent from the certification program organizer (in my case, AVILEN).
Enter the code somewhere when you apply for this exam.
In addition, an examination fee of 30,000 yen (excluding tax) is required.</p>
<h3 id="10-take-the-e-qualification-test">10. Take the E qualification test.</h3>
<p>This exam must be taken at the designated exam location.
There are many people who take the test in Tokyo, so it seems that the test venue was full and we could not reserve the test. I was a rural area, so I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about it.
The test site is a PC school, and the designated PC will be used. Basically, I couldn&rsquo;t bring my personal belongings, and I was instructed to use the pen and notepad provided by the computer.
I think that in the exam questions of this exam, machine learning related questions were given quite a bit. In programming, im2col or col2im, the optimization algorithm of the gradient descent method is a question. Unexpectedly, I think that there were questions related to reinforcement learning. Also, it is better to check carefully which of the axis values in numpy.sum() is the total value for each column and which is the total value for each row.
As for exam preparation, I focused on the materials distributed in the certification program, the final exam questions (3 types), the example of this exam, and Volumes 1 and 2 of &ldquo;Making from scratch&rdquo;. During the last week, I repeated the exam questions and the exam examples.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/DeepLearning-Ian-Goodfellow/dp/4048930621/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_ja_JP=Katakana&amp;keywords=DeepLearning&amp;qid=1580534278&amp;sr=8-1">Deep Learning</a>(PublishedCompany:KADOKAWA)
To be honest, I am not familiar with this book, but since it is treated as a textbook in the certification program, it is used to refer to the necessary parts as appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/CreateDeep-LearningfromZero-TheoryandImplementationofDeepLearningLearnedfromPython-Saito-Kasuoki/dp/4873117585/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_ja_JP=Katakana&amp;keywords=Createfromscratch&amp;qid=1580534435&amp;sr=8-1">Create Deep Learning from Zero</a>(Publisher:O&rsquo;ReillyJapan)
You should definitely buy this book.
I read it considerably and used it as a countermeasure for various issues.
It was also super helpful for understanding error backpropagation.
I think I spent 50% of my total study time on this book.-<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/CreateDeep-LearningfromZero---NaturalLanguageProcessing-Saito-Kasuoki/dp/4873118360/ref=sr_1_2?__mk_ja_JP=Katakana&amp;keywords=Createfromscratch&amp;qid=1580534435&amp;sr=8-2">Create Deep Learning 2 Natural Language Processing from Zero</a>(Publisher:O&rsquo;ReillyJapan)
You should definitely buy this book as well.
It is better to suppress forward propagation and back propagation of LSTM and GRU, and it will be helpful for understanding them.
I studied almost only natural language processing in this book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certification program lecture materials
This is not a book, but I used it when studying for this exam, so I listed it.
It&rsquo;s a good idea to check how to calculate various formulas and functions along with the explanation in the video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certification exam completion exam questions and explanatory materials (3 types each)
This is also not a book, but I used it when studying for this exam, so I will list it.
I think that it will take root sooner if you check various calculation formulas and function derivation methods while solving problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example of this test
This is also not a book, but I used it for studying this exam.
It was distributed around the 4th part of the certification program.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="authors-specifications-before-attending-the-certification-program">Author&rsquo;s specifications before attending the certification program</h2>
<ul>
<li>I was developing embedded software in C language.</li>
<li>I buy Deep Learning made from scratch immediately after the release (around October 2016), but I am frustrated by the forward propagation.</li>
<li>Since I participated in several object recognition related seminars, I knew how some kind of object recognition works.</li>
<li>I had already obtained the G test, so I knew the terms CNN and LSTM.</li>
<li>There is almost no knowledge of machine learning.</li>
<li>Python is about basic grammar, and numpy and pandas are bite.</li>
<li>What is information theory?</li>
<li>Linear algebra is enough to understand matrix multiplication. What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors?</li>
<li>Statistics knew that high school-level probabilities could be calculated, and the formulas for variance and standard deviation were known. What&rsquo;s a college-level story like Bayesian statistics?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impression-after-taking-the-e-qualification">Impression after taking the E qualification</h2>
<p>It is not natural to say, &ldquo;A scout from GAFA immediately after getting an E qualification!&rdquo; (Lol)
However, it led to the confidence that I cleared the good test range and the good submission. It is also a proof that there is a considerable amount of knowledge about AI.
The classes in the certification program were fun. I was very excited to learn new things from smart people.
Although the start of the certification program was late and I was on a last minute schedule, in 2019 I was lucky enough to have nine consecutive holidays. I was able to secure more than 10 hours of study time per day during those nine consecutive holidays, so I think that was the reason I was able to pass.
I think that I did my best, and the experience that it led to the result was the most valuable asset.
If you are unsure about whether or not to take the test, please first attend the certification program information session.</p>
