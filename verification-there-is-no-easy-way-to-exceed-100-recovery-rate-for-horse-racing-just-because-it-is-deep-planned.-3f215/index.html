<p>Original article: <a href="https://qiita.com/yossymura/items/334a8f3ef85bff081913">With a deep learning, the recovery rate can exceed 100% in horse racing</a></p>
<h1 id="first-try-to-move">First try to move</h1>
<p>I will purchase the program and try it.
As described in the explanation, basically it worked with copy and paste, but the following two places did not work as they are, so I fixed it here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsing date data</li>
<li>Column names of features used for learning and inference</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look exactly the same because it contains random elements, but the graphs also moved in roughly the same way, so it seems to have been reproduced.
If you try to buy the &ldquo;*3 range where the third place index is 60 or more and the odds are not too high (per 55-60)&quot;**, as I said in the article, 100% will be in my hand Exceeded.
It seems that the number of races and records has increased since last week (the week of Queen Elizabeth Cup).</p>

<p>#What kind of horse is predicted
What kind of horse did you buy and exceeded 100%? I wonder if you are aiming for a more qualified race than the main race.
However, the DataFrame of the verification data did not contain the horse name, it contained only preprocessed values such as horse numbers and popularity, and the odds were not raw data, so it was very difficult to understand. It could not be investigated without creating separate data.</p>
<h1 id="try-to-change-from-deep-learning-to-another-model">Try to change from deep learning to another model</h1>
<p>This is the code I changed.
Even if compared to a simple neural network, let&rsquo;s change to a simpler logistic regression.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python:" data-lang="python:">from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

model = LogisticRegression(C=2.0, penalty='l1', random_state=42, multi_class=&quot;auto&quot;)
model.fit(df_train, train_labels)
</code></pre><p>This time, using the output of this model <code>model.predict_proba(df)[:, 1]</code> as the third-place index, <code>&quot;the third-place index is 60 or more and the odds are not too high. Try to buy &quot;</code> around 55-60).</p>

<h1 id="is-the-data-wrong">Is the data wrong?</h1>
<p>I feel that the data is biased rather than deep learning.
Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m considering buying:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python:" data-lang="python:">Set 0.01 to 0.08 if you want to purchase a range of #1 to 8
if win3_pred &gt;= 0.60 and 0.01 &lt;= odds &lt;0.08:
    return 1
else:
    return 0
</code></pre><p>win3_pred is the third place index before multiplying by 100.
I&rsquo;m worried that the odds are still standardized (0.01 to 0.08 is equivalent to the ordinary winning odds of 55 to 60), but I will rewrite it as follows.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python:" data-lang="python:">if 0.01 &lt;= odds &lt;0.08:
    return 1
else:
    return 0
</code></pre><p>This is a simulation to buy a winning betting ticket when the odds of winning are 55 to 60 times without using the 3rd place index at all.</p>

</code></pre></div><p><code>past_time_sec1 ~ past_time_sec5</code> represents the time of the past 5 runs of the horse.
This means that horses that don&rsquo;t have all the time for the past five runs are abandoned here.
Especially in the ages of 2-3, there are variations in the number of runs for each horse. For example, if you were Fukushima 10R Fukushima 2-year-old S on November 10, 2019 last week, there are 14 runners (<a href="https://race.netkeiba.com/?pid=race_old&amp;id=c201903030410),">https://race.netkeiba.com/?pid=race_old&amp;id=c201903030410),</a> but the time for the past 5 runs has been gathered. There are 3 of them, and actually there were only 3 in the dataframe after deletion.
With this <code>dropna</code>, the number of records is 471500 -&gt; 252885 **.
**About half of the data is discarded. ** The data discarded here are the horses that are 2-3 years old, the local horse (because the local horse race has not acquired the data), and the 2010 data (there is no data for 2009, so the previous race information cannot be acquired). It was the center.
It doesn&rsquo;t seem right, but it&rsquo;s not a fatal mistake because it can be excluded by the same rule during inference.</p>
<h1 id="how-many-wins-will-be-refunded-for-a-win">How many wins will be refunded for a win?</h1>
<p>If the number of races is 8 or more, up to 3 will be won, if it is 5 to 7, 2 will be won, and if it is 4 or less, it will not be sold.
The following processing was done **for verification data.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python:" data-lang="python:"># Focus on races with 2 or more double wins and 5 or more all
win3_sums = df.groupby('race_id')['win3'].sum()
win3_races = win3_sums[win3_sums &gt;= 2]
win3_races_indexs = win3_races.index.tolist()

win3_counts = df.groupby('race_id')['win3'].count()
win3_races2 = win3_counts[win3_counts &gt;= 5]
win3_races_indexs2 = win3_races2.index.tolist()

race_id_list = list(set(win3_races_indexs) &amp; set(win3_races_indexs2))
</code></pre><p>By this process, the number of records becomes <strong>48555 -&gt; 42999</strong>, and 11.4% of the data is discarded.
Originally I would like to throw away the race that did not have a multiple win refund, but it is too many to think about.
In fact, no more than 4 races in JRA in 2018-2019 (at least in my keibadb)
This process is a problem.</p>
<p>#What&rsquo;s going on
What&rsquo;s wrong?
Since <code>win3</code> is the objective variable that indicates whether or not the player has entered the finish order within the multi-win zone, the above process counts two or more horses in the multi-win zone and five or more horses in the race.
But please remember. <strong>Horses that don&rsquo;t have consistent results over the past five runs have already been discarded</strong>, so horses that shouldn&rsquo;t be erased have disappeared**.
It&rsquo;s a bit confusing, but let&rsquo;s look at it in detail. For example, Kyoto 12R on November 2, 2019.
<a href="https://race.netkeiba.com/?pid=race&amp;id=p201908050112&amp;mode=shutuba">https://race.netkeiba.com/?pid=race&amp;id=p201908050112&amp;mode=shutuba</a>
Records of the 4th Boccherini, 7th Sunray Pocket, 9th Narita Blue, 10th Theo Amazon, and 12th Metropole have been excluded in advance because the race times of the last 5 races are not complete, and 8 of them stand up. It will be regarded as a race.
The finish order for this race was 4-3-7. Since it is a race with 13 heads, the winning combination is 4, 3 or 7.
However, since *4 and 7 horses have already been erased from the DataFrame, it means that only one horse has won the race in this race**. It will be one and will be excluded from the verification data.
**This operation cannot be done for future races as we obviously don&rsquo;t know which horse will be a winning ticket before the race**
By the way, the 5th Nihon Piro Halo of this race lost the win odds of 60 times, but I lost it (in terms of verification data, I did not have to buy one horse to lose at 55 to 60 times).
I can see it little by little. It seems that some horses are disappearing from the verification data regardless of the learning model, and they seem to be biased.</p>
<h1 id="lets-verify-with-the-correct-data">Let&rsquo;s verify with the correct data</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try inference without improper narrowing down.
Since there are no races that did not have a multi-win refund in 2018-2019, there is no need to narrow down the verification data. Let&rsquo;s simulate purchase with verification data that is not commented out and narrowed down</p>

<p>The recovery rate of 145% is</p>
<ul>
<li>3rd place index (deep learning model prediction)</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t buy horses that don&rsquo;t have the same time in the previous 5 runs</li>
<li>Win odds 55-60 times</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been achieved under these three conditions.
Both the hit rate and the recovery rate have dropped, but it is a normal profitable calculation.Is this the ability of deep learning?</p>
<p>#What kind of horses do you highly appreciate?
When does the third place index get higher?
I tried learning with Decision Tree by using the class of whether the third arrival index is larger or smaller than 0.5 as the correct answer data.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python:" data-lang="python:">from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)
clf = clf.fit(df[all_columns], df.win3_pred &gt;0.5)

<p>Apparently, <code>past_odds1</code>, that is, <strong>win win odds for the previous race</strong> and the finish order for the previous race seem to be important.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s simply specify the third place index in the purchase condition as 10 times or less of the winning odds of the previous run of the rule base.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python:" data-lang="python:"># if win3_pred &gt;= 0.60 and 0.01 &lt;= odds &lt;0.08:

The left is for all data, and the right is for data with all 5 runs.
The results for each year (147.22%) under the conditions that gave the same figures as deep learning are the data for 2018 and 2019 in the table on the right.
You can see that in some cases, even if you purchase under the same conditions, the recovery rate may be less than 60% **.</p>
<p>#Conclusion
The reason for replacing the 3rd place index within 10 times the previous winning odds was 147.22% because it is from 2018 to 2019 **, and the recovery rate of 100% will be achieved by this rule in the future It seems to be difficult to do.
Then how about the third place index? Plotting the relationship between the 3rd place index and the running odds&hellip;

Of course, we are using other features as well, but you can see that the lower the odds of the previous run, the higher the third place index. **
It was exactly what Decision Tree taught me.</p>
<p>The original article was titled &ldquo;If you have deep learning, you can exceed 100% recovery rate in horse racing&rdquo; **
Actually, ** ``Recovery rate is 100 when a simulation is performed by removing horses that have not had the same time in the past 5 runs and purchasing a horse bet with odds of 55 to 60 times winning 2018 to November 2019. It is possible to use rules instead of deep learning to exceed the percentage, and it happens by chance.''**
I think that it is such a content.
**Isn&rsquo;t it possible to exceed 100% recovery rate in horse racing just because of deep learning?**</p>
<p>(Since I analyzed it all at once and wrote it all at once, I may have made a mistake. Please tell me if you made a mistake.)</p>
<h1 id="lack-of-love-for-data">Lack of love for data</h1>
<p>What I want to say throughout this article is to take a closer look at the data.
This time, I had a feeling that the mystery could be solved, and it was fun. <strong>Basically, the data is interesting</strong>. There are various viewpoints and various discoveries. The data of Titanic&rsquo;s survival analysis is also interesting just by looking at it. ――
You can see a lot of things as you properly deal with data. That&rsquo;s how good a model can be, and no matter how deep learning or good algorithms you use, a model that doesn&rsquo;t care about data won&rsquo;t be a good AI. **
If you want to get along with the data but don&rsquo;t know what to start with, let&rsquo;s go to the racetrack!! It&rsquo;s fun without making money!!!</p>
