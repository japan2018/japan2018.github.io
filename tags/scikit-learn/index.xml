      <description>#1. Purpose  If you want to do machine learning, anyone can use scikit-learn etc. to implement it relatively easily. However, in order to achieve results at work or to improve your level, The explanation &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand the background but I got this result&amp;rdquo; clearly shows the weakness.
In this article, the purpose of ** is 2-3, &amp;ldquo;I will use scikit-learn first because the theory is good,&amp;rdquo; and 4 and &amp;ldquo;understand the background from mathematics&amp;rdquo; **.</description>

      <description>Currently (2020/03/03), all the teaching materials of N prep schools are released free of charge due to the suspension of elementary and junior high school due to the spread of COVID-19 infection. It is said that I am also working on &amp;quot;Introduction to machine learning&amp;quot;, but a little trouble occurred in &amp;quot;12. How to handle missing values&amp;quot;.  error
 ImportError: cannot import name&amp;rsquo;Imputer&amp;rsquo; from&amp;rsquo;sklearn.preprocessing&amp;rsquo;
 The version of scikit-learn that I use is 0.</description>

      <description># What we could achieve  Since we were able to build the following environment with Docker, we summarized the flow from Docker image build to JupyterLab startup.
 Easy Python version switching (Python3 â‡„ Python2) Easy startup of JupyterLab 1 Can be deleted as soon as the environment is no longer needed I want to easily build an environment on Mac and Windows  Actually built environment  macOS Catalina (MacBook Pro(15-inch, Late2016)) Windows 10  Docker image You need to login to get it.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve delivered an article with the theme &amp;ldquo;How to use machine learning for work?&amp;rdquo; In this third installment, we will introduce concrete programming under the theme of &amp;ldquo;Python coding procedure&amp;rdquo;.
If you also read the back number, you can understand the whole from machine learning basics to Python coding, so please use it.
 Part 1: Understanding the purpose of machine learning Part 2: Overview of AI development project  Since various information is also sent on SNS, please feel free to read the article.</description>

      <description>This article is from the 15th day of the Fujitsu Systems Web Technology Advent Calendar.  (Promise) The content of this article is my own opinion and does not represent the organization to which I belong.
Introduction In this article, we use scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library. I have summarized the procedure and the result when I tried handwriting recognition of runes **. While the advent calendars of this Advent Calendar are putting in great features and know-how that are likely to be useful for actual work, However, I made something that was just fun for me, and I cannot help being so enthusiastic.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Hello everyone.
Do you use a matching app? ! I feel good as one of those who have recently matched with a matching app.
By the way, the matching app I was using was able to refer to the data of other popular members. (Probably people who have received more than 100 like are displayed.)
When I saw it, I was disappointed.
&amp;ldquo;Like, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get 100&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; ** &amp;ldquo;I want to be a man who exceeds 100&amp;rdquo; **</description>
