      <description>@Raclett3&#39;s  Python programming whose parents were killed by literals of strings, numbers and truth values I think it&amp;rsquo;s very interesting :raised_hands:, but at the same time I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand what was happening, so I looked into it. It&amp;rsquo;s a commentary or my own study.
I mainly write &amp;ldquo;small numerical values&amp;rdquo;. If you make a mistake, throw Masakari.
#0
int() # 0 This is as per @Raclett3&amp;rsquo;s link.
 or return 0 if no arguments are given</description>
