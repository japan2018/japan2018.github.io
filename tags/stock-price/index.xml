      <description>## What is average pairwise correlation  I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many people in the world need to do this calculation.
The average pairwise stock correlation is the average of the correlation coefficients of price movements between stocks. In general, during the crisis such as the Lehman shock or the European debt crisis, the market as a whole will fall sharply, and then it will rise sharply in reaction, and the correlation coefficient between stocks will increase.</description>
