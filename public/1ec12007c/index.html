<p>You can read all the news in one article in 30 seconds! Below is a summarized example.</p>
<p>** [Before Summary] **</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The women&rsquo;s golf US tournament tournament was held in Australia on the final round on the 9th, and Suzu Yamaguchi&rsquo;s score fell sharply to 39th place with a total of 5 overs. Yamaguchi, who started 10th from the leader in 33rd place, finished the final round with 1 birdie, 3 bogeys, 1 double bogey, 1 triple bogey, 7 scores and 5 overs, and was 39th. The winner was Park Hee-yeon, who won the playoffs of three Korean players, all lined up with 8 unders, and won the tour&rsquo;s third victory.</p>

The final round of the women&rsquo;s golf tournament in the United States was held in Australia on the 9th, and Suzu Yamaguchi&rsquo;s score dropped sharply to total 39th place with 5 overs. The winner was Park Hee-yeon, who won the playoffs of three Korean players, all lined up with 8 unders, and won the tour&rsquo;s third victory.</p>
<p>** [Before Summary] **</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Katsuo Matsumoto, a swimmer, participated in the men&rsquo;s 100-meter freestyle at the tournament held in Yamaguchi City and won the championship at the time close to her personal best. Matsumoto participated in the men&rsquo;s 100m freestyle at the “Kirara Cup” held in Yamaguchi City on the 9th. In the race of the final, Matsumoto aggressively skipped from the beginning and returned to the top 50 meters in the first half of the race, then continued to protect the lead and won the race with a time of 48.79 and a personal best of 0.27. Matsumoto, who specializes in freestyle, won the silver medal in the 200m Freestyle Men&rsquo;s World Championship last year and became the first Japanese player to win the podium in this event, including the Olympics. For the Tokyo Olympics, it is expected that it will be a pillar of Japan&rsquo;s national team not only in individual events but also in relay events, and at this competition, which was held as a part of training without reducing the practice amount, we will show high ground strength. It was. Matsumoto said, &ldquo;The Olympics have a long period and I have to be fast even if I am tired, so I played in the image of the actual performance. It was a good match.&rdquo; Matsumoto has decided to conduct high altitude training in Mexico from the middle of this month, and will be the final selection for the Japanese championship in April by becoming the representative selection committee of the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
