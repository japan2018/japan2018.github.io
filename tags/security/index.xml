      <description># Cyber security framework &amp;quot;MITRE CALDERA&amp;quot; introduction: Function overview and operating environment construction     Red Team Screen Blue Team Screen           The above image is the MITER CALDERA version 2.6.6 Web client screen.  Introduction Effect My job is cyber security research, and I am particularly interested in human resource development. During my research, I encountered an OSS (Open Source Software) called &amp;ldquo;MITRE CALDERA&amp;rdquo;, and it was a potential tool that could be used for human resource development, so I would like everyone to know, use, and make this article.</description>

      <description>#Ancient representative code  Caesar cipher (shift cipher) Cryptographic implementation Caesar encryption is performed by shifting the alphabet by a certain number of characters. When the number of shifts is n, it is called ROT N. For example, 3 is ROT3.
#encryption def encrypt(plain_text, shift_num): cipher = &amp;#34;&amp;#34; # ciphertext for char in plain_text: if(char.isupper()): # when uppercase cipher += chr((ord(char) + shift_num-65) %26 + 65) else: # when lowercase cipher += chr((ord(char) + shift_num-97) %26 + 97) return cipher #Plaintext plain = &amp;#34;draemon&amp;#34; #shift number, key s = 3 print(&amp;#34;Plain Text :&amp;#34; + plain) print(&amp;#34;shift_num :&amp;#34; + str(s)) print(&amp;#34;cipher :&amp;#34; + encrypt(plain, s)) When run</description>
