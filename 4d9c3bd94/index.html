<p><img src="https://hackernoon.com/drafts/6i17k30ki.png" alt="Cover"></p>
<p>Did you know? Over half of IT projects have failed.
For many of us who are aware of the complexity and dynamic nature of the software development industry, it&rsquo;s less shocking.</p>
<p>Keeping pace is essential to survive in this unpredictable industry with constant innovation and progress.
The wise not only take advantage of software development services, but weigh the pros and cons of all technologies.</p>
<p>Global IT spending is estimated to reach US$4,101.8 billion by 2021.
Below is a graph showing the results of the <em>Statista</em> survey from 2005 to 2021.
<img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/w6n3meqS5kSiaK2pnn0qw1keSSd2-2f230m8" alt="Graph"></p>
<p>Huge investments hold entrepreneurs&rsquo; expectations.
All investors aim to achieve high return on investment (ROI).
The software industry has many benefits, but all you need to learn is how to enjoy them.</p>
<p>Keeping up with the times, our development team must grow according to the latest trends.
There is no other way to survive the intense competition in the IT industry.</p>
<p>2019 was a year of virtual reality, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain and many other trending technologies.
2020 will bring several new technologies.</p>
<p>These techniques have been introduced by skilled software developers to meet customer demands.</p>
<p>Are you excited about using trending technologies in your software development projects?
Take a look at software development trends in 2020.
You need your focus and consideration to achieve maximum results in the future.
Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at these trends.</p>
<h1 id="no1-increased-dependence-on-ai">No.1 Increased dependence on AI</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since AI appeared in software development services.
However, its adoption methods have evolved and strengthened dramatically each year.
Most companies use AI in their software to add value to their customers.</p>
<p>In a recent survey, 84% of respondents believe that implementing AI can make them more competitive than their competitors.
This technology, along with related technologies such as machine learning and deep learning, has many applications in every industry.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/320164/8b4f6d82-6079-b113-49e0-dda6a6ed0c38.png" alt="www2.png"></p>
<p>Custom software developers don&rsquo;t have to take every step to introduce new ways to adopt AI in their business.
By 2020, it is expected that some amazing ways of implementing AI in web app development will be witnessed.</p>
<p>Chatbots are a new trend included in every app or website.
Chatbots, AI technologies have replaced human customer service executives.
In fact, AI is all about reducing human involvement and increasing machine dependence.</p>
<p>In 2020, more chatbots, more accurate customer behavior analysis, and fewer HR appointments.
AI automates all tasks with maximum accuracy, reliability, and speed.</p>
<h1 id="no2-5g-network">No.2 5G Network</h1>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be surprised to see a network 100 times faster than 4G!
By the end of 2020, 5G networks will enter the market.
Inferred to offer broader connectivity, 5G has attracted many software development companies.</p>
<p>5G is estimated to provide better data security.
In addition, the development of virtual reality apps such as 3D games will be improved along with augmented reality apps.
Not only businessmen but also amateurs are waiting for this network.</p>
<p>#No.3 Edge processing (edge computing)</p>
<p>The global edge treatment market is projected to grow approximately 28-fold between 2018 and 2025.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/320164/3a0a923c-3487-e793-adc9-2f0b58315001.png" alt="1.png"></p>
<p>What is the reason researchers believe that edge treatment shows such dramatic growth?
This is because it is used to upgrade cloud technology.</p>
<p>Is edge processing better than cloud technology?
Edge processing is advantageous for remote locations where there is poor connectivity to centralized locations.
In addition, it can be used to process time-sensitive data, but the cloud is not suitable for this purpose.</p>
<h1 id="no4-instant-app-instant-apps">No.4 (Instant App) Instant Apps</h1>
<p>In 2016, we introduced instant apps to the world of software development.
These apps have the functionality of the apps but behave like websites.
You don&rsquo;t have to download them. That is, the device does not need to provide memory.</p>
<p>The instant app can also be used for testing purposes.
Mobile app developers launch these apps to test them before launching.
It&rsquo;s smaller than a regular app and offers a better user experience.</p>
<p>Another benefit of these apps is improved conversion rates.
Therefore, looking at its strategic importance, it is expected that the number of instant apps will increase after 2020.</p>
<p>#No.5 Programming Trend</p>
<p>As with software development trends, programming trends are of great value.
Many new programming languages or frameworks have become popular and some are disappearing.</p>
<p>In addition to dynamic software technology, development tools have an unstable market presence.
Although in all other research Javascript and PHP are the most used programming languages for frontend and backend programming languages.
Many other tools are constantly becoming popular.</p>
<p>One such language is python, which is most commonly used for AI and ML (machine learning) development.
The diagram below shows <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/">Stack Overflow</a> growing steadily among other major programming languages ..
<img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/w6n3meqS5kSiaK2pnn0qw1keSSd2-jquu30ni" alt="img"></p>
<p>#No.6 Mixed reality</p>
<p>Not new! But the constant improvement of virtual and augmented reality creates new surprises every year.
Therefore, it is speculated that VR and AR will shake with amazing abilities next year.</p>
<p>Companies are investing in their own apps based on virtual reality development services.
This is because ventures and small businesses are chasing giants like Walmart and the US Army.</p>
<p>From military training to 3D games, complex technology finds every niche application of our time.
AR-based education apps are a new trend that takes education service technology to a new level.</p>
<p>Today, AR apps bring stories to life to improve children&rsquo;s understanding and learning.
The mixed reality world market is expected to grow exponentially over the next few years.
In fact, it is estimated to reach $180 billion by 2023.</p>
<p><img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/w6n3meqS5kSiaK2pnn0qw1keSSd2-51vr30ro" alt="img"></p>
<p>There are many amazing technologies that can improve your business processes, not just your lifestyle.
As a smart entrepreneur, you need to include AR/VR in your software to enjoy the benefits of this technology in the future.</p>
<p>#No.7 Outsourcing</p>
<p>Outsourcing for the software industry has become very popular in recent years.
It is estimated that during 2019-2023, the IT outsourcing market will thrive with a CAGR of 4.42%.</p>
<p><img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/w6n3meqS5kSiaK2pnn0qw1keSSd2-dpwu30n3" alt="img"></p>
<p>2020 will be the year we welcome more IT outsourcing projects.
Companies are always looking for ways to find the most economical way to include all the latest technology trends in their products.</p>
<p>A Technavio study found that a key driver of IT outsourcing needs was the growing need for business process optimization.
IT outsourcing companies are hired with the trust of providing excellent software development services to their companies.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion-software-development-trend-2020">Conclusion: Software Development Trend 2020</h1>
<p>The software development industry is expected to revolutionize these trending technologies within the next year.
The constant advancement of technologies such as AI and AR/VR is the main reason behind the dynamic nature of this industry.</p>
<p>Incorporating these prosperous technologies into every product is essential to the evolution of the product.
That is the only way to survive in this competitive world.
If you want to win this match, hire an engineer who can open a custom path for you.</p>

<p>#Personal impressions</p>
<p>When it comes to demand for AI, there is no doubt that it will grow larger and larger, and it will become an ordinary thing like air and will exist everywhere.
And for 5G, it&rsquo;s very interesting to see if it could be the reason for the lack of new mobile content, <strong>flutter</strong> Let&rsquo;s do it: relaxed::point_up:</p>
