      <description>I recently researched the point spread function (PSF), which often appears in the context of lens design, and the specific numerical calculation method for MTF curves, so I summarized them. I&#39;m not an expert in lens design, and I&#39;m not from a physics department, so I&#39;m afraid there are some mistakes, but I&#39;d appreciate it if anyone noticed.  About point spread function (PSF) Point spread function (PSF) is a function that represents the intensity distribution of light on the image plane when a point light source forms an image on the image plane.</description>

      <title>[Python] Article that enables high-speed sparse matrix calculation</title>
      <link>https://memotut.com/python-article-that-enables-high-speed-sparse-matrix-calculation-e5500/</link>

      <description>#Introduction  **A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements of the matrix are 0. It is used in a wide range of fields such as numerical calculation, machine learning, and graph theory (I think). Since most of the matrix is 0, if you devise to ignore 0, you can perform matrix calculation at high speed. For example, if you use a large-scale sparse matrix (nearly 90% is 0) (1 million rows x 1 million columns) and only use non-zero parts, the calculation time will be about 1/10 and the calculation can be completed quickly.</description>

      <title>[Python] Fluid simulation: Implement diffusion equation</title>

      <description>#Introduction  While also studying Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which is a discipline related to the simulation of fluids such as air and water, I would like to summarize (in multiple articles) the knowledge necessary to construct a numerical fluid analysis code for water.
I feel that computational fluid dynamics is a difficult academic subject, so I would like to write it so that even beginners can understand it as much as possible.</description>

      <description>Hello from the abyss of the universe!  \displaystyle\int {\rm d}\boldsymbol{r}\hat{\psi}^{\dagger}(\boldsymbol{r}) Poppin Friends \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r}) is! This time, I would like to introduce **13 methods of calculating the circle ratio $\pi$ in Python.
In the past, I read the article [&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not worried about pi anymore! 10 ways to find pi&amp;rdquo;]&amp;rdquo; (https://www.procrasist.com/entry/pi_1) (famous in pi region) , The desire to &amp;ldquo;Ï€ seek&amp;rdquo; was amplified, so I came to write this article. And this time, I tried to implement almost all of the method of finding $\pi$ in the article in Python **!</description>

      <title>The story of numerical calculation of differential equation with TensorFlow 2.0</title>

      <description>#Introduction  TensorFlow 2.0 is a very powerful framework for machine learning such as deep learning. TensorFlow handles numerical calculation algorithms abstractly in the form of &amp;ldquo;calculation graphs&amp;rdquo;.
It looks like an execution plan in SQL. This will likely separate the &amp;ldquo;algorithm definition&amp;rdquo; from the &amp;ldquo;execution&amp;rdquo;. If used properly, would it be very useful not only for machine learning but also for general numerical calculation?

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulation to try for the time being</title>
      <link>https://memotut.com/molecular-dynamics-simulation-to-try-for-the-time-being-4bacf/</link>

      <description>In this article, I&#39;ll briefly explain about molecular dynamics and try a simple simulation. For the simulation, we will use a Python module called [Atomic Simulation Environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html).  What is molecular dynamics? Molecular Dynamics (MD) obtains dynamic processes of atoms and molecules by solving equations of motion based on interactions (potentials) between atoms and molecules.
What we see around us is an aggregate of atoms and molecules, if we look at it in detail.</description>

      <title>Numerical calculation of compressible fluid by finite volume method</title>

      <description># 1.First of all  It is necessary to consider the compressibility of the fluid in the flow around a fast-moving object such as an aircraft or rocket, and in the phenomena involving strong pressure, temperature and density changes such as combustion and explosion. Compressible fluids have various phenomena such as sound waves, shock waves, and aerodynamic heating that are not found in incompressible fluids, and their numerical calculations have different difficulties from incompressible fluids.</description>
