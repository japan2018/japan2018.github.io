</p>
<pre><code>I became a Kaggle Expert, so I decided to go and write a poem.
</code></pre>
<p>I hope it will be a reference for those who are interested in AI but can not even program **.
#1. Initial specifications (February 2019)</p>
<ul>
<li>Master&rsquo;s degree in mechanical engineering. Frequent mechanical engineers</li>
<li>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t really like linear algebra or statistics. Good at mechanics.</li>
<li>AI? That&rsquo;s right. Shogi, isn’t it super strong?</li>
<li>Python? Is it like a striker boxer?</li>
</ul>
<p>#2. Current specifications (December 2019)</p>
<ul>
<li>Kaggle Expert (subtlety?)</li>
<li>Reasonable results in machine learning competition (Kaggle Kuzushiji Recognition 7th, Signate tellus 3rd 5th)</li>
<li>Machine learning: Somehow you can code.</li>
<li>Deep learning: Somehow coding.</li>
<li>You can read related papers. Simple things can be implemented.</li>
<li>Business application has become apparent</li>
</ul>
<p>#3. Opportunity to learn machine learning
For myself, I had a year of &ldquo;Nothing good! I couldn&rsquo;t get it!&rdquo;, and I just tried to do something new.
In fact, a little <strong>the world is expanding</strong>. Machine learning is recommended for engineers who are doing the same thing every day or are becoming a copy of their boss**.</p>
<p>#4. Flow of learning
First, the overall flow is shown in the figure.
Except for the first month and the end, we only practice competition.

<p>##4.1 Introduction (First month)
####Coursera Machine Learning
You know Andrew Ng&rsquo;s machine learning course. Most of the basics can be learned. It&rsquo;s definitely better to do this than to take any paid course. it&rsquo;s recommended.</p>
<ul>
<li>The explanation is polite and easy to understand. It compliments me.
*Become comfortable with programming problems, so learn them</li>
<li>You can do it anywhere. You can watch videos on the train.</li>
<li>But it&rsquo;s free!</li>
</ul>
<p>Somehow, at the end of the <strong>, you will feel more secure just by looking at the teacher&rsquo;s face</strong>: relaxed:</p>
<h4 id="deep-learning--python-implementation-book">Deep Learning × Python implementation book</h4>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any knowledge of Python, and because Coursera&rsquo;s free course didn&rsquo;t include deep learning, I appropriately dumped a book.
I learned the matrix calculation of Python (especially numpy), how to make simple diagrams, and the super basics of deep learning. Personally, I recommend a system that moves your hands.
In addition, &ldquo;[First Deep Learning-Neural Networks and Back Propagation Learned with Python-]&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%81%AF%E3%81%98%E3%25">https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%81%AF%E3%81%98%E3%</a> 82%81%E3%81%A6%E3%81%AE%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E3%83%A9%E3%83% BC%E3%83%8B%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0-Python%E3%81%A7%E5%AD%A6%E3%81%B6%E3%83%8B%E3%83% A5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A9%E3%83%AB%E3%83%8D%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%83%AF%E3%83%BC% E3%82%AF%E3%81%A8%E3%83%90%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%83%91%E3% 82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3-Machine-Learning-%E6%88%91%E5%A6%BB/dp/4797396814)&rsquo;&rsquo; was.</p>
<p>##4.2 Kaggle debut (1-2 months)
When I learned that there was a data science competition called Kaggle, I thought, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s the best to be able to combine study and profit (prize)!&rdquo;, and immediately registered.</p>
<p>I was shocked by the very grateful fact that the solution was shared.
But when machine learning &amp; programs that aren&rsquo;t even understandable are written in English, laymen can be a bit teary: fearful:</p>
<p>At that time, there was a competition in which various Japanese people helped, including Qiita. Yes, it&rsquo;s Titanic</p>
<h4 id="titanic-competition">Titanic competition</h4>
<p>It is a competition that is always held in Kaggle. It is a competition that predicts who will survive among the people who board the Titanic (various people with different age, gender, status).</p>
<p>Since it was my first time doing everything, it was a pain just to manipulate the table data. Of course it&rsquo;s my first time with pandas. However, **You can have a complete experience of data cleansing, feature analysis, model building, validation, and inference. **
There is a wealth of information online, so I learned a lot. We also implemented decision trees and random forests for the first time. I think there was no loss in doing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see machine learning, I see,&rdquo; I was in good shape and immediately jumped into a prize-winning competition.</p>
<h4 id="kaggle-wire-competition">Kaggle Wire Competition</h4>
<p>For me as a mechanic, the failure analysis system was an easy subject to tackle. It was also an interesting topic in terms of time series data that I often see.</p>
<p>For the first time I saw RNN, GBDT, etc., it was a battle of the gods. I am in a mood.</p>
<p>I did not hesitate to copy and paste the public solution (kernel). While submitting it while playing around with it little by little, the code that belonged to another person becomes more and more familiar. (However, as you add it, it becomes dirty code and the score does not change much)
<strong>You just have to copy and paste and defeat it at first</strong>, surely.</p>
<p>I knew the result, but it was super bad. However, thanks to the kernel, I learned a lot from python coding to time series data analysis. Thank you to everyone who gave me the kernel.</p>
<h4 id="kaggle-earthquake-competition">Kaggle Earthquake Competition</h4>
<p>I was in a good condition to have mastered the time series, and I will take part in a competition of the same series that happened immediately after. **This time I tried to reach the submission without looking at the open solution. **</p>
<p>While worries and trial and error, you will be able to learn a lot and gain the experience of achieving it yourself. You can never get it with a passive attitude (just reading a book). After all, I felt that learning in a competition was wonderful and good.
<img width="400" alt="2.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/557686/2a9b072f-ae7d-b64a-29b0-6ffcdbae8556.png"></p>
<p>After that, we will participate in <a href="https://industrial-big-data.io/phmc2019-datachallenge/">Machine Learning Contest for Manufacturers sponsored by Dentsu International Information Service (ISID)</a> and win the whim. This was also time series data.
If you&rsquo;re interested, I&rsquo;d love it as it may be this year.</p>
<p>##4.3 And to deep learning (3-4 months)
I have become interested in deep learning, especially in the image field. This is because the lunch box that I regularly ordered at home was so bad that I could distinguish it with AI. I thought that was the trigger.</p>
<h4 id="lunch-arrangement">Lunch arrangement</h4>
<p>I took a picture of a bento if I couldn&rsquo;t do it.
The bride looks at me with suspicious eyes as I move the arrangement and take pictures. Color Age goes over and over.</p>
<p>CNN (convolutional neural network) was treated seriously for the first time. I didn&rsquo;t have so many images, so I learned transfer learning. Of course I don&rsquo;t have a GPU, so I will use <strong>Google Colab(*)</strong>.</p>
<p>Although I got a little accuracy, I could only make a mysterious evaluation system that gave me the same score. I was disappointed that Google Drive was full of bento images, so I decided to stop it. **It was a failure. <strong>After all</strong> Solid goals and objectives are important. **</p>
<p>** The best Google free service to say the least. Deep learning with a browser*</p>
<p>####Signate Tobacco Competition-First object detection-
I found out that there is a domestic competition platform called Signate, and I saw that there was a competition related to images, so I participated.</p>
<p>**Competition to apply the brands of cigarettes displayed on the shelves. **This is the first object detection task. I thought that mastering transfer learning was the perfect task for me.</p>
<p>But what about object detection? YOLO?SSD? What is it? I found out that YOLO is up to v3. That seems pretty good too. Fortunately the implementation was rolling so I could easily see the code.</p>
<p>However, the content is messy, and the person who wrote it seems only to God. There is no help for it, so this time too, it&rsquo;s almost circular at first **. However, as you fiddle with it, it gradually becomes your own code. (And it&rsquo;s becoming more and more dirty code like poop :poop:)
At this point, you will be able to read a little paper. Fortunately, YOLO was full, so I read a lot.</p>
<p>But after all it was Zako, so I can not win a prize. However, around this time I became interested in object detection, so I continued to read papers.</p>
<p>**Although I can understand everything, I think there is a considerable difference between &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; and &ldquo;I know&rdquo;, and I think there is a big gap between &ldquo;I can&rdquo;. I think proper reading and implementation are important. **</p>
<p>Note that Signate often cannot share the solution, so I personally recommend Kaggle to debut.

<p>##4.4 Intro to Table Competition (4th-5th month)
When I noticed the importance of machine specs in an image competition and got tired of bad learning iterations, I challenged myself to a table competition. I had a bit of a bit of a time series competition, but I had no experience with ordinary table competitions.</p>
<p>Around that time, an interesting competition will be held at Signate.</p>
<h4 id="iida-sangyo-land-competition">Iida Sangyo Land Competition</h4>
<p>It is a very basic competition that predicts the price of land properties in Saitama.</p>
<p>I was able to learn the joy of creating various feature quantities, such as calculating the time distance from longitude and latitude, and creating the area per room from the number of rooms. It becomes quite a habit if the features that flashed suddenly affect the accuracy**. I think this kind of place is very suitable for an idea man who is good at various thoughts and delusions. The substance in the brain comes out.</p>
<p>I was able to learn more about the importance of validation. I didn&rsquo;t know much when I was told by Professor Andrew at Coursera, but poor validation can lead to contradictions when assessed in terms of accuracy. I think this kind of place is also a great knowledge that can be gained by the competition.By the way, it&rsquo;s a bonus that you can (uselessly) learn more about Saitama.</p>
<p>I also took a sneak peek at the molecular competition, but I didn&rsquo;t have much time after all. GNN looks fun and learning is a topic for the future.</p>
<p>##4.5 Image competition relapse (6-9 months)
I&rsquo;ve been studying detection tasks since the Tobacco Competition, just as Japan hosted a competition at Kaggle.</p>
<h4 id="kaggle-breakdown-competition">Kaggle Breakdown Competition</h4>
<p>It was a task to detect and classify the broken letters. Detection itself was not such a hard task, so I tried to implement it myself. By this time, I was able to implement the paper a little, so I actively tried new things.</p>
<p>Thanks to kaggle for taking care of me, <strong><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kmat2019/centernet-keypoint-detector">I also shared the solution with the kernel. </a></strong></p>
<p>I faced the most convoluted neural net so far. If you are aware of the points you want to show, it seems that you can see the neural network properly.
For the first time, I was also made to think seriously about the influence of context. Looking at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03305">The elephant in the room</a>, I found CNN interesting. Interestingness was a big driving force, and we made various trials and errors.</p>
<p>The importance of validation, which I learned in the land competition, was also put to good use. If the same author&rsquo;s documents were mixed in training and validation, the accuracy would be overestimated. Group Split was the correct answer.</p>
<p>It was a Kaggle competition, but it was a miraculous competition with no medal, so it was <strong>miraclely ranked 7th</strong>.
Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s out of the bounty zone, but I was given awards, which helped me to improve my motivation.

<p>####Signate Sea Ice Competition
<strong>If you can do a detection task, you can also do a segmentation task</strong>. (I think the former is more troublesome for modeling)
I participated in the sea ice competition held at Signate in the right place.
The sea ice area is identified by looking at the high-resolution measurement image acquired by the satellite.</p>
<p><strong>By this time, I was able to read a paper to some extent and could implement it too</strong>, so I played with loss functions and described the latest models such as EfficientNet.
It was a 6-sub, but I was in 5th place. I was out of the prize zone this time because I was covered by the Russian (?) Unfortunately, due to Signate&rsquo;s rules, the solution cannot be shared: frowning2:

<p>#5 Summary
** So, machine learning is fun, so let&rsquo;s do it together: relaxed:**</p>
<ul>
<li>Even people who are unfamiliar with software are okay! (It is important for the brain to be able to consider &ldquo;why&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Even amateurs can become Matomo for a year!</li>
<li>Recommended for competitions that deal with actual data and provide learning through practice
*We recommend a competition that gives you the enjoyment of up and down the ranking and accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>#6 Finally
I heard that I became a Kaggle Expert, but when I looked closely I didn&rsquo;t have any competition medals. I&rsquo;m sorry
