      <description>#Introduction  I summarized the article about using LINEBot with Django because it was a little researched and it was old.
For the time being, I will create an Omukai Bot that returns the text sent as an introduction to LINE Bot.
Here article uses SDK, but I&amp;rsquo;m a Python beginner ~~ I can&amp;rsquo;t even throw an HTTP request with Python ~~ I want to do it.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Django beginner with less than a week of Django history.</description>

      <description># This year again IBM Cloud × LINE bot  In last year&amp;rsquo;s Advent Calendar, we introduced How to make a LINE bot using IBM Cloud Node-RED. Thanks to the Advent Calendar, a recent Google search for &amp;ldquo;Node-RED LINE bot&amp;rdquo; has brought this article to the top. It is good to easily create a LINE bot with Node-RED, but in the case of IBM Cloud&amp;rsquo;s Node-RED, if you do not edit the flow for a while with a light plan, the application will stop and the LINE bot may not work.</description>

      <description>The other day, at the wedding reception of an acquaintance, I was asked for entertainment for the first time, and I managed to survive.  What should I do I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to own. Singing and dancing are not masters. I can make some movies, but it seems to be done by the side of the bride. .. : Only programming! !
