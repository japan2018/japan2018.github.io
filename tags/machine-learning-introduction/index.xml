      <description>It is a moment if you use scikit-learn, but you can also implement it yourself as a study.  In the original article, multi-class classification and train_test_split were out of scope, so
It is simplified to a 2-class problem and evaluated with the same data as the training data.
Please refer to the following article for details. Machine learning starting from scratch #4 &amp;ldquo;Logistic regression&amp;rdquo;
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris import numpy as np iris = load_iris() X_org = iris.</description>
