      <description>#This grade  #This impression
It&amp;rsquo;s not bad in performance (although it took 1 hour), I couldn&amp;rsquo;t solve either E or F, so I&amp;rsquo;m very sorry. For the time being, I would like to review what E and F were missing and review.

Whether or not 7 is included can be handled as a character string. Why are you converting it to a list? My head is too bad.</description>
