      <description>This article is the 20th day of Retty Advent Calendar 2019.  Yesterday, Mr. Hirano&amp;rsquo;s “Retty Data Analysis Team-Review of the 2nd year after launch ~Data platform/data democratization/statistical model~”.
Nice to meet you. My name is Koda and I&amp;rsquo;m currently an intern at Retty as a 20-year-old engineer.
For the time being, I was wondering what to write after registering for participation, but I made my own entry/exit management system (electronic lock) that is used in the laboratory of the university I am attending, so I will talk about it.</description>
