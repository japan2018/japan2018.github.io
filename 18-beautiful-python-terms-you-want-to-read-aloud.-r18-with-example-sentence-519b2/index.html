<p>Python, which is known as a frozen tuna script language,
It is also famous for its many beautifully named packages.</p>
<ul>
<li>PyPy</li>
<li>pypan</li>
<li>pypants</li>
</ul>
<p>Reference: 7 Python terms to read aloud
<a href="http://doloopwhile.hatenablog.com/entry/20120120/1327062714">http://doloopwhile.hatenablog.com/entry/20120120/1327062714</a></p>
<p>Enchanted by these beautifully named packages,
<strong>How beautifully named packages exist</strong>
**I really decided to investigate. **</p>
<p>The reference information is a little old from 2012,
If you look again now, you will surely find a <strong>more beautiful name</strong>! !</p>
<h1 id="survey-policy-and-overview">Survey policy and overview</h1>
<p>Python package management system = all packages targeted for <strong>pip</strong>
It is registered in <strong>PyPI</strong>.
<a href="https://pypi.org/">https://pypi.org/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>It seems that there is a school of whether or not to read &ldquo;paipai&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Totally &ldquo;<strong>219,370</strong>&rdquo; pieces! (*As of February 2020)
It is not the amount that can be confirmed by hand.</p>
<p>I would like to exclude dormant packages that are not used at all,
<strong>Package with one or more installations in the last year</strong>
I would like to target.
For example, the reference site lists,
<strong>Pychinko</strong>
Does not already exist in the world, is excluded,
<strong>Pyzuri</strong>
Unfortunately, there seems to be no download at all, so it is excluded.</p>
<p>All these package names and their download information are
It can be obtained by using <strong>pypinfo</strong> and <strong>BigQuery</strong> (details described later).</p>
<p>Since the package name is alphanumeric,
<strong>Forcibly read katakana</strong> Japanese conversion processing is performed.
(Because the package name is not a simple English word,
(This is a fairly difficult process)</p>
<p>Finally, using the <strong>&ldquo;Beautiful Word List&rdquo;</strong> created in advance
Search for the package name localized in Japanese.</p>
<p>With such steady efforts,
<del>Omoshiroi</del> A package with a beautiful name
**We have found a lot! **</p>
<h1 id="result-announcement--">**Result announcement! ! **</h1>
<p>Before the code, I will introduce the result earlier.
I found many things, but I chose 18 of them.
If the reference article is the Heisei edition,
18 selections of Reiwa version, I will call it &ldquo;<strong>R18</strong>&rdquo; for short.</p>
<p>Please enjoy the beautiful name of <strong>Paison</strong> with example sentences.</p>
<ul>
<li>Furigana is not an official reading
This is the automatic addition result by the Katakana reading conversion tool created this time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the large amount of Paipai, the total amount cannot be stated.
I&rsquo;m sure many packages are easy to use.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s praise it in April

<p>When it&rsquo;s April, by all means actually at work or school
Let&rsquo;s read it aloud.
<strong>I think people around you will feel the arrival of spring</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The following are technical details, so I think many people don&rsquo;t have to look at them. ~~
Please refer to those who are interested.</p>
<p>** Seriously introduce ** packages with beautiful names **,
And this article ** which explains the ** acquisition code is
<strong>I&rsquo;m not worried about being &ldquo;censored/deleted&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
<p>However, as seen by the adult-minded adult,
It may be received <strong>with a meaning different from the original intention</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>This article about various circumstances</strong>
**Please note that it may disappear unexpectedly. **
Please try it at hand before it disappears.</p>
<h1 id="-package-list--download-number-information-acquisition-pypinfo">① Package list &amp; download number information acquisition (pypinfo)</h1>
<p>In PyPI where the pip package is registered,
The statistical data set
It is published on <strong>Google/BigQuery</strong>.
A tool that can easily obtain that information
It is <strong>pypinfo</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to operate BigQuery,
Follow the steps on the site below
<a href="https://github.com/ofek/pypinfo">https://github.com/ofek/pypinfo</a>
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account,
You need to create authentication information (JSON file).</p>
<p>Once you have created the JSON file, in your browser
Colaboratory (<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/?hl=ja">https://colab.research.google.com/?hl=ja</a>)
Start up and execute the command as follows.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py:Mount" data-lang="py:Mount">from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
</code></pre><pre><code class="language-py:" data-lang="py:">!mkdir &quot;drive/My Drive/PYPI&quot;

</code></pre><p>In addition, by country, version, installation OS, etc.
You can get various information, so please try following the example on the official website.</p>
<p>As stated in the above &ldquo;Estimated cost: $0.34&rdquo;,
With BigQuery, every time you throw a query,
Please note that you will be charged for the amount of data read.
However, with 1 TB/month of Always Free frame,
With a $300/year free tier for new GCP users,
You can use it normally.
Please be careful not to fire only heavy queries of the total acquisition type.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s finally throw this data acquisition query.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py:" data-lang="py:">!pypinfo --days 365 --limit 250000 &quot;&quot; project &gt;&quot;drive/My Drive/PYPI/PYPINFO_365_LIST.txt&quot;

#| botocore | 693,156,212 |
#| requests | 656,942,399 |
# ～～ omitted below ～～

</code></pre><p>For your information,
The total number of downloads in the last year is
About 37,498,000,000 times
There were approximately 215,000 types of packages.</p>
<p>Since the total number of packages is about 220,000,
Looking at the last one year level, what is registered
Most are &ldquo;alive.&rdquo;
Because there is no Pychinko said to have existed before,
It may be inventoried regularly.
Also, since I saw about 134,000 kinds in the last 30 days,
Is there less than 100,000 kinds that are used fairly properly?</p>
<h1 id="-processing-of-acquired-data">② Processing of acquired data</h1>
<p>The file with the package name and the number of downloads obtained earlier is
It&rsquo;s easy and convenient for people to read at hand,
To handle it programmatically, you need to parse and process it.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the removal of the cost row of the query at the beginning and the heading row/Total row of the table.
Make the LIST format by processing as follows.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py:" data-lang="py:">f = open('/content/drive/My Drive/PYPI/PYPINFO_365_LIST.txt')
line = f.readline() # read line by line (including: newline character)

pypinfo_list = []
while line:
  #If there are three thresholds = Heading, frame and Total are jams, but other than that can be determined by this condition
  if line.count('|') != 3:
    line = f.readline()
    continue
  else:
    #Remove line feed code, comma, and half-width space
    parsed_line = line.replace('\n', ``).replace('','').replace(',', ``)
    one_data = parsed_line.split('|')
    Use the middle two in the form #['','urllib3', '950108414','']
    #Remark: Numerical values are treated as character strings for now
    one_data = one_data[1:3]
    pypinfo_list.append(one_data)
    line = f.readline()
f.close

#Remove the first two heading lines and the last total line
pypinfo_list = pypinfo_list[2:-1]
</code></pre><p>Although I think that it may not be provided by pypinfo,
I made it myself. Even if there is,
The query costs about $3 each, so rather than throwing it separately from the text version,
It will also save the number of queries.
I think that ① and ② are also useful when doing &ldquo;data analysis&rdquo; related to Python.</p>
<h1 id="technology-to-make-package-name-katakana-alkanapy--work-hard">③Technology to make package name katakana (alkana.py &amp; work hard)</h1>
<p>Now, the package names can be listed,
For example, urllib ⇒ Url Lrib
python-dateutil ⇒ Python-Date Util
To convert the package name to katakana, such as
What do you do?</p>
<p>The policy is the following four steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Katakana words that exist as English words</li>
<li>Katakana IT special terms such as Python, AWS, and GIT</li>
<li>Apply &ldquo;Romaji conversion&rdquo; as much as possible</li>
<li>Convert the remaining fractional characters appropriately: f⇒F, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first, &ldquo;English words in katakana&rdquo; is
I used the conversion table of <strong>alkana.py</strong>.
<a href="https://github.com/cod-sushi/alkana.py/blob/master/README_ja.md">https://github.com/cod-sushi/alkana.py/blob/master/README_ja.md</a></p>
<p>About 2-4, mainly from the Roman alphabet rule table,
I created a conversion table of about 330 lines.
Add the above data from alkana.py,
Make a conversion table as alkana_list.</p>
<p>The point here is to use the length of the English string as a key,
Sort alkana_list in descending order.</p>
<p>Put the length of the character string in the item of ```py:x[0] beforehand.
alkana_list = sorted(alkana_list, key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)
For high-priority items such as #py ⇒ pie and python ⇒ python,</p>
<h1 id="30pypie-and-so-on-will-increase-the-priority-by-registering-as-long">[30,&lsquo;py&rsquo;,&lsquo;pie&rsquo;] and so on will increase the priority by registering as long.</h1>
<pre><code>
The transformations will now be applied in order from longest words.
The actual conversion is as follows.
Due to the amount, it takes about 50 minutes each time.
You can display the progress in the middle with tqdm as follows,
It will be easier to save it with pickle after processing.

```py: Add Katanaka reading information to all modules
from tqdm import tqdm

pypinfo_jp_list = []
for pypinfo in tqdm(pypinfo_list):
  #Japanese module name storage variable (English is stored at this point)
  jp_module_name = pypinfo[0]
  for data in alkana_list:
    #Convert the conversion table in order.
    jp_module_name = jp_module_name.replace(data[1], data[2])
  pypinfo_jp_list.append([pypinfo[0], jp_module_name, int(pypinfo[1])])

print(len(pypinfo_jp_list))
print(pypinfo_jp_list[0:10])

import pickle
with open('/content/drive/My Drive/PYPI/pypinfo_jp_list.pickle','wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(pypinfo_jp_list, f)
</code></pre><p>As a special natural language processing tool,
There may be some uses.</p>
<h1 id="-look-for-packages-that-use-beautiful-words">④ Look for packages that use &ldquo;beautiful words&rdquo;</h1>
<p>Finally, look for packages that contain certain keywords.
Register your favorite word** in &ldquo;Beautiful_tango_list&rdquo; in advance,
Just loop.
If you use a lot of terms such as &ldquo;pai&rdquo;,
Be aware that the results can be huge.
This time, there is a certain &ldquo;site that lists elegant words&rdquo;
I borrowed the word.</p>
<p>In Colaboratory, I think the print output is up to 5000 lines, so
If you go about 10,000 lines, it is better to output to a file as follows.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Search" data-lang="Search">result_str = &quot;&quot;
for word in Beautiful_tango_list:
  result_str += &quot;■&quot; +&quot; &quot;+ word + &quot;\n&quot;
  for data in pypinfo_jp_list:
    if word in data[1]:
      result_str += str(data) + &quot;\n&quot;
  result_str += &quot;\n&quot;
  
with open('/content/drive/My Drive/PYPI/Beautiful_Result.txt','w') as f:
  print(result_str, file=f)
</code></pre><p>**Thank you. **
Using these techniques &amp; codes, like the results above,
I was able to find many packages with beautiful names.</p>
<p>#Postscript</p>
<p>**The naming sense of Python is deep.
As you look up the next word when you look up in the dictionary,
Even just by coincidence with the name,
It would be great if you could meet your favorite packages.</p>
<p><strong>The fateful encounter that PyPI brought together</strong>,
It can be said that
The reason for my interest in technology was &ldquo;I was worried about my name.&rdquo;
But isn&rsquo;t it okay?</p>
<p>Since it is an article that seriously introduces the package,
You might associate a meaning different from the original intention,
**Do not throw stones for adults whose hearts are dirty. **
Best regard.</p>
<p><strong>Come on, everyone else</strong>
**Pai ○ and Pai ○
** Did you like it? **</p>
<p>To the wise readers who have read this far,
<strong>The words in ○ are clear</strong>.</p>
<p>If there were people who misunderstood or complained about this article,
It must be a person who usually thinks about such things**.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all from the scene.</p>
