<small><code><a href="https://memotut.com/tags/github">GitHub</a></code></small>

</p>
<pre><code>GitHub Apps is a new format for applications that work with GitHub.
</code></pre>
<p>This format is the marketplace for applications, <a href="https://github.com/blog/2359-introducing-github-marketplace-and-more-tools-to-customize-your-workflow">announced with GitHub Marketplace</a>. In other words, the ecosystem for creating GitHub Apps, publishing on the marketplace, and making money with it has been put in place.</p>
<p>In this article, I&rsquo;ll show you how to create GitHub Apps that spread such dreams.</p>
<h1 id="application-format-that-works-with-github">Application format that works with GitHub</h1>
<p>First, organize the format of applications that work with GitHub, including GitHub Apps.</p>
<h2 id="webhooks">Webhooks</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/">Webhooks</a>isaformatthattriggersaspecificevent(suchaspushing) of the repository and notifies the updated information to the server etc. .. Make settings in the following locations. Here, you can also set the events to be notified.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/25990/4b76dac4-6afe-a779-b9d7-2d1fba60dec2.png" width=400 /></p>
<p>In addition, Webhooks <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/hooks/">can be set for each Organization</a>, in which case it is possible to receive events from all repositories under the Organization. Become.</p>
<p>However, because Webhooks only &ldquo;receive&rdquo;, you cannot perform any operation on the GitHub repository side (such as adding a comment to Issue). If you need to take some action on the GitHub repository side, you need to use the following OAuth Apps together or make it GitHub Apps.</p>
<h2 id="oauth-apps">OAuth Apps</h2>
<p>As its name (OAuth), OAuth Apps will be in a format that operates on GitHub repository etc. using the authentication information of GitHub user account. Therefore, when creating OAuth Apps, you need to register from Settings&gt; Developer settings of the user account.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/25990/40674cfc-e762-1275-5fd2-ba3d6b526c60.png" width=400 /></p>
<p>This is used not only for apps that link with GitHub, but also for the development of sites that simply use GitHub user accounts as authentication information (login information). Regarding OAuth authentication, usually <a href="https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/about-authorization-options-for-oauth-apps/#web-application-flow">Authenticate by sandwiching page transition</a>doesnothaveascreeninthefirstplacewhenitisaservicelinkedwiththebackend,so<a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth_authorizations/#get-or-create-an-authorization-for-a-specific-app">offlineauthenticationflowisalsosupported</a>.</p>
<p>Since OAuth Apps uses &ldquo;GitHub user account authentication information&rdquo;, if the user loses access authority or closes the account, the linkage will of course end. This is rather natural for individuals to use, but it is not preferable when doing team development etc. (such as the person who withdrew from the project member set up cooperation!). In addition, it is possible that you do not know who OAuth is linked to.</p>
<p>In other words, OAuth Apps are good for apps/sites that &ldquo;GitHub users&rdquo; personally use, but they are a bit of a problem for team-managed &ldquo;GitHub repositories&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="github-apps">GitHub Apps</h2>
<p>GitHub Apps is a format suitable for developing apps for &ldquo;GitHub repository&rdquo; with respect to OAuth Apps mentioned above. This is because the install unit is the repository unit held by the user/Organization.</p>
<p>Because you can receive not only access to the repository but also the occurrence of events in the repository (with webhooks), you can develop applications that &ldquo;react to specific events in the repository and do something with the repository&rdquo;. This is the optimum method.
OAuth authentication can also be performed, so in addition to using it for login authentication, it is not used as GitHub Apps but <a href="https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-github-apps/identifying-users-for-github-apps/">on behalf of the user (with the user&rsquo;s access token)</a>Itisalsopossibletoprocesstherepository.Thiscanbeusedwhencreatingarepository-basedsitesuchasGitter(Ithinkthatvariousideassuchaschatandtaskmanagementwillspread).</p>
<p>The differences between the detailed authentication methods are described below.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-a-new-integration/about-choosing-an-integration-type/">About choosing an integration type</a></p>
<p>This time, we will look at the development of this GitHub Apps.</p>
<h1 id="github-apps-development">GitHub Apps Development</h1>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at the steps to actually develop GitHub Apps.</p>
<h2 id="registering-github-apps">Registering GitHub Apps</h2>
<p>First, register the GitHub Apps to be developed. This registration is possible for each user or organization. Follow the steps below to register.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-github-apps/registering-github-apps/">Registering GitHub Apps</a></p>
<p>The GitHub Apps registered here will be installed and used by your user in the repository. The permissions registered here are required for the GitHub Apps that will be developed in the future, and are the permissions granted by the installing user.</p>
<h2 id="github-apps-authentication">GitHub Apps authentication</h2>
<p>If you use OAuth authentication also in GitHub Apps, it will be the same as OAuth. In this case, since the API will be used by using the access token of the user, the operation that the authenticated user cannot do cannot be performed naturally.</p>
<p>When authenticating as GitHub Apps, you can use the access token obtained there to operate the permissions granted in Permissions. This time we will look at the certification process.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-github-apps/about-authentication-options-for-github-apps/">About authentication options for GitHub Apps</a></p>
<p>To authenticate as GitHub Apps, you need the private key (pem file) obtained when registering GitHub Apps. Using this, authentication is performed using the method <a href="https://jwt.io/introduction/">JSON Web Tokens(JWT)</a>. The flow is as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create JWT including Private Key and send it by including it in Authorization header</li>
<li>Check this JWT on GitHub side, and if ok, issue an access token that enables access to the installed repository.</li>
<li>Use this access token to execute API</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/25990/5229d12c-4d6b-001f-501c-d8cdae47c284.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>The package that creates JWT is developed in each language, and you can use the one that suits the implementation language (Note that you need to encrypt with RS256 for authentication on the GitHub side, so be careful. please).</p>
<p><a href="https://jwt.io/#libraries">Libraries for Token Signing/Verification</a></p>
<p>It should be noted that this certification was quite successful. I need to specify the validity period of the access token (up to 10 minutes), but sometimes this date and time check did not work well. This point [was addicted](<a href="https://platform.github.community/t/issued-at-claim-iat-must-be-an-integer-representing-the-time-that-the-(assertion-was-issued/1549),">https://platform.github.community/t/issued-at-claim-iat-must-be-an-integer-representing-the-time-that-the-(assertion-was-issued/1549),</a> I made it possible to authenticate stably by setting the issue date a bit in the past.</p>
<p>The code I have recently created for authenticating with GitHub Apps is the following part, so I hope you can refer to it when implementing it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/chakki-works/typot/blob/master/typot/env.py#L27">chakki-works/typot/env.py</a></p>
<h2 id="implementation-of-processing-for-github-repository">Implementation of processing for GitHub repository</h2>
<p>Once authenticated, you can then use the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a> to perform various operations on your GitHub repository.</p>
<p>In addition, GitHub plans to make the API based on <a href="https://developer.github.com/v4/reference/mutation/updatepullrequestreview/">GraphQL</a>, so I used it when creating it in the future. I think it&rsquo;s better.## Testing GitHub Apps</p>
<p>Due to the format of GitHub Apps, a test repository is indispensable for testing. Install GitHub Apps created in this test repository, and check whether the process is triggered for a given event and whether the process can be properly performed on the repository.
Global access is required for testing webhooks and authentication, but since it is a bone to deploy it to some server one by one, it is convenient to use <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a>.</p>
<p>That said, you still have to register the Issue to actually trigger the event. Fortunately, you can use &ldquo;Redeliver&rdquo; to re-send previously published events from the &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; tab of the GitHub Apps registration page, so you should use this.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/25990/0dbbcc79-d122-4b87-9967-e2d8e0d53e30.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>After that, I personally saved the JSON that was actually published in a test file and used it for local testing.</p>
<p>The test is pretty hard like this, but when it&rsquo;s done, we&rsquo;re finally ready to publish!</p>
<h1 id="publishing-github-apps">Publishing GitHub Apps</h1>
<p>Publish the developed application to the market immediately! You may think, but I must tell you such a sad fact.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.github.com/apps/adding-integrations/listing-apps-on-github-marketplace/requirements-for-listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/">Requirements for listing an app on GitHub Marketplace</a></p>
<ul>
<li>For OAuth Apps, there must be at least 1000 registered users</li>
<li>For GitHub Apps, have a minimum of 250 installations</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other requirements such as security, but I think the above two points are the most difficult to meet. It means that new apps aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In addition, the number of installed repositories cannot be confirmed on the screen at the moment, but it is necessary to confirm it by hitting the following API.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/#find-installations">GitHub Apps/Find installations</a></p>
<p>Please refer to the GitHub Apps that I created the other day because I have a script to do the counting.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/chakki-works/typot/blob/master/get_installations.py">chakki-works/typot/get_installations.py</a></p>
<p>Then there is no place to open it &hellip; but there is a light version of Works with GitHub.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/works-with">Works with GitHub</a></p>
<p>You can apply for this if it meets the GitHub service agreement etc. (For details, see [here](<a href="https://developer.github.com/apps/adding-integrations/adding-integrations-to-works-with-See(github/requirements-for-adding-an-integration-to-works-with-github/)">https://developer.github.com/apps/adding-integrations/adding-integrations-to-works-with-See(github/requirements-for-adding-an-integration-to-works-with-github/)</a>.
Please note that once you apply, you can&rsquo;t modify the description, etc., and you can&rsquo;t modify it without requesting the contact once approval has passed. <a href="https://developer.github.com/apps/adding-integrations/adding-integrations-to-works-with-github/adding-an-integration-to-works-with-github/">It seems that you review every Friday</a>, apply before Friday.</p>
<p>However, I have also been using GitHub for a long time, but this is the first time I have known the existence of this site, and the workability of &ldquo;Works with GitHub&rdquo; is unusually low. (There is also no link from the GitHub portal). Therefore, the benefits posted here may be small.</p>
<p>Finally, I will introduce the repository of GitHub Apps that I created. We hope you find it useful as a reference for your implementation.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/chakki-works/typot">chakki-works/typot</a>
(If it helps, I would be encouraged to get Star m(_ _)m)</p>
<p>Please refer to the following article for the function.</p>
