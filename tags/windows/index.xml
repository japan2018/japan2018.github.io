      <description>#Introduction  I used WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)+Ubuntu to install the NEologd dictionary for MeCab morphological analysis, but it was relatively easy to install with git for Windows and 7-zip.
Since I wrote about user dictionaries in the previous article â†“, this time it is the system dictionary. https://qiita.com/zincjp/items/c61c441426b9482b5a48

      <title>[Python] How to install Deep Learning Framework Tensorflow 1.0 on Windows Anaconda environment</title>

      <description>#Introduction  Until now, we have been doing deep learning by running Tensorflow on the back end of Keras. If you just do machine learning in Python, you can use Keras as before, but there are applications where you want to use models and weights learned in Python in C++. Actually, it would be nice to use a model trained with Keras, but it seems easier to code directly with Tensorflow which also has a C++ API, so I will try to attack from there.</description>

      <description># What is a batch file?  This is a file that describes a series of commands executed on Windows. There are two types of batch files with the extension &amp;ldquo;.bat&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;.cmd&amp;rdquo;, but the operation is basically the same. If you would like to know more about this difference, please refer to the following articles. What is .cmd (extension)
Why do you need this feature? It was difficult to learn batch commands simply.</description>

      <description>Chainer now depends on Cython, h5py since 1.5. The installation method on Windows is described in [2nd day article (Install Chainer 1.5.0 on Windows)](http://qiita.com/icoxfog417/items/ca1521f9d62183cea234) I would like to add some supplements so that you can easily use proper Chainer on Windows.  This content may contain errors. We will update as soon as we notice. Operation reports are welcome. Thank you for your comment
