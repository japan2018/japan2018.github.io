      <description># I tried convolution with sensor data (1 dimensional vector)  The convolutional neural network is generally used in image processing, but this time, I tried using a one-dimensional vector as seen in sensor data. The point is to convert the data structure using reshape to make it pseudo-three-dimensional (RGB, X, Y), which is the same as the image. I think that convolution can extract features even if there are few learning parameters, and is effective in detecting anomalies.</description>
