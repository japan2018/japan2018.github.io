      <description>I recently researched the point spread function (PSF), which often appears in the context of lens design, and the specific numerical calculation method for MTF curves, so I summarized them. I&#39;m not an expert in lens design, and I&#39;m not from a physics department, so I&#39;m afraid there are some mistakes, but I&#39;d appreciate it if anyone noticed.  About point spread function (PSF) Point spread function (PSF) is a function that represents the intensity distribution of light on the image plane when a point light source forms an image on the image plane.</description>

      <description>What is #Mitsuba2  A free physically based renderer for academics. There are new features such as differentiable rendering and polarized rendering. Other related articles I wrote are below.
-Try the latest physics-based renderer Mitsuba2 (1) Introduction -Try to touch the latest physics-based renderer Mitsuba2 (2) Move from Python -Try the latest physics-based renderer Mitsuba2 (4) Polarization rendering -Difference between BRDF and polarized BRDF (pBRDF)
The assumption is that Mitsuba2 has been installed.</description>
