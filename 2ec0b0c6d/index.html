<pre><code>#Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>###Self-introduction
My name is Chizu Chizu. I&rsquo;m 14 and I&rsquo;m 2 now.
It is a hobby type, but I was particularly typing. (Past tense)</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m a low skill Kagler.</p>
<p>I got a bronze medal in &ldquo;tentatively&rdquo; IEEE. We&rsquo;ll see later on why it&rsquo;s a tentative one.</p>
<p>After getting tired of AtCoder, I got into Kaggle. I will definitely become a master by my own power.</p>
<h3 id="what-made-me-want-to-write">What made me want to write</h3>
<p>I wanted to write an advent calendar.
I thought I&rsquo;d write something, but now I&rsquo;m not at the level of introducing skills with skills, so I&rsquo;d like to convey the current state of the current Kaggle stagnation in a realistic manner.</p>
<p>After all I thought that Kaggle was like a competitive professional, but I licked it completely. If you don&rsquo;t do things properly, you can&rsquo;t live&hellip;</p>
<p>In summary, it is an article that <strong>Kaggler who cannot analyze data analyzes himself</strong> (self-development scientist).</p>
<p>It may be hard to read because it is only letters, but I&rsquo;m happy if you can read it. Also, the advice can be noisy. Please.</p>
<p>The lessons are summarized below.</p>
<h3 id="kaggles-current-slump">Kaggle&rsquo;s current slump</h3>
<p>I thought it would be better to write down your current situation than to write up to now and from now on.
I&rsquo;m participating in various competitions now, but I&rsquo;m in a slump and there are so many things I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<h4 id="language-barrier">Language barrier</h4>
<p>I speak Japanese.I&rsquo;m not good at English.I&rsquo;m learning English.I should keep learning a lot:)
My native language is Japanese so I am not good at English. (I&rsquo;m trying to learn a little online English conversation)</p>
<p>Kaggle is all in English. Discussion too. Of course, you can write it in Japanese, but it will be a discussion between Japanese people, so it seems that you should use English even with Google Translate.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s a foreign language, so it&rsquo;s difficult, but you can understand it if you read it properly. (Especially notebooks have graphs and codes)
I thought that what I couldn&rsquo;t do because of language was just an excuse.</p>
<p>If you do not speak strangely, you can answer and answer most questions in junior high school English. (Normally on GitHub issues and discussions)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unreadable if you use Google Translate, but there is still some resistance. All my smartphone settings are in English, so I try to use English everyday (but I&rsquo;m not used to it at all).</p>
<h4 id="i-dont-understand-the-essence">I don&rsquo;t understand the essence</h4>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a problem that comes with language barriers, but I don&rsquo;t know what to analyze because I don&rsquo;t know the characteristics of the data in the first place, so I just read EDA and don&rsquo;t understand it. It&rsquo;s closed. I wonder if you can read the EDA kernel a million years early without understanding what you want to do. I regret.</p>
<p>How many times have you been fraudulent?</p>
<p>When the days that I don&rsquo;t understand are repeated, I become more depressed and become motivated. I was full of motivation because I knew what I would do because I was in Japanese at the time of my navi competition.</p>
<p>I am motivated, but I feel like I am giving a beach flag in Gori fog and I want to give up</p>
<p>I want to read Kaggle books and try to find the front as much as possible&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="glitter-programming-i-cant-be-a-beginner">Glitter programming I can&rsquo;t be a beginner</h3>
<p>If anything, I&rsquo;m just a contributor of existence darkness.</p>
<p>There are many darkness incidents, such as a build failure and destroying the entire environment to initialize the OS, or overflowing the memory swap to fill the 1TB SSD and make it unbootable&hellip;</p>
<p>Kaggle&rsquo;s discussion There are many people who find interesting features when I look at it, and I am impressed, but I wonder how many hours I have been staring at the data until then.</p>
<p>If I can understand the essence, I think it&rsquo;s already here. Since I know what to do, I am willing to increase my score by making hypotheses, experimenting and proving it, and increasing my score.
If you understand the essence, will you be a glitter programmer?</p>
<h5 id="story-that-crashed-trying-to-become-a-bracketed-programmer">Story that crashed trying to become a bracketed programmer</h5>
<ul>
<li>Use class to add comments at the document level</li>
<li>Log management up to unnecessary points (even if log management is doubtful in the first place)</li>
<li>Shiny coding with proper use of Git</li>
</ul>
<p>As I pursued the ideal image, I crashed. The reason is simple: I could not write the essence (data science) because I was able to write time where it was not the essence.
I also thought of using Git, but I forget to commit because I am writing the code whimsically.
It is troublesome to check the variables inside when using class, so I will try to write it like a notebook as much as possible.</p>
<h4 id="what-happened-at-the-ieee-competition">What happened at the IEEE competition</h4>
<p>That competition was my first competition to win a medal at kaggle. However, since I finished it without knowing anything, I can not be proud of it &hellip; because I was progressing without understanding much of the data and I did not understand it, so if I played around with parameters or making feature quantities I do not understand well, I got a score by chance I just went up. Although it may be a part of my ability, I realized that it was not a medal = I did it because I did almost nothing and I did not understand anything.
For the above reasons, I wrote that I got a &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; medal.</p>
<p>I want to get a proud medal in this competition&hellip;</p>
<p>####Summary</p>
<p>Children who cannot read textbooks are in a state. (I bought a book about a year ago)</p>
<p>It is written that humans without reading comprehension will change to AI, but if there is no reading comprehension of humans making AI, it will fall down&hellip;</p>
<p>I thought that it was necessary to improve the reading comprehension of the data or the comprehension of the competition.</p>
<h3 id="reflections-and-lessons">Reflections and lessons</h3>
<h4 id="understand-the-purpose">Understand the purpose</h4>
<p>I thought this was probably the most important thing. Until now, I had somehow looked at the data and coded it without knowing the &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;, but after all, it did not work at all. Moreover, I don&rsquo;t understand the discussion well (because I don&rsquo;t understand the purpose)</p>
<p>For the time being, I found that in the beginning I should start by understanding the purpose, clarify what I should do, and then proceed with the competition. I&rsquo;ll probably read the overview if I&rsquo;m lazily doing a mysterious EDA or doing an unknown analysis. (It seems to be useful as a starter kernel)</p>
<h4 id="output-">Output (?)</h4>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this applies to everyone because I&rsquo;m a beginner, but I think I&rsquo;m probably a good person to output.</p>
<p>As I have already understood the purpose, I can not proceed unless I understand the purpose, but what if I had a toddler understanding? You! What are you doing! Wrong! (Extremely) You won&rsquo;t be able to run normally unless you are stung.</p>
<p>I think that the output may be evaluated in some cases, so I thought it should be done as much as possible within the common sense.</p>
<p>In the past, there was also a Japanese Kernel with a mixture of black history (I wrote it in English, but I made it myself), but I think it was worth it.</p>
<h4 id="i-wont-let-you-down">I won&rsquo;t let you down</h4>
<p>This is a lesson learned from the My Navi competition.
Actually, I did a little bit of my Navi competition at the beginning, but I gave up because the accuracy did not improve at all, but I will do it for the team after the team merge! ! ! ! So I did a lot of research and analysis to find new discoveries.</p>
<h4 id="add-a-habit-of-taking-notes">Add a habit of taking notes</h4>
<p>I felt that I should make a note of all what I did today (experiments and results) on both the Jupyter Notebook and the Slack one-person channel. After three days, I forget about people, and I can&rsquo;t remember what I did each day in a two-month competition. I thought that I should take notes to understand what I should do and to avoid unnecessary experimentation. (I don&rsquo;t think you need to write for a long time)</p>
<p>The past log of Slack was also helpful for my navigation competition. I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to individual participation, but I realized when I was working as a team.</p>
<p>###in conclusion
Thank you for reading.</p>
<p>By writing this article, I feel like I can escape from the downturn.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is all, and after all it is less than Kaggle Expert, so it may be far from the optimal solution.
I wonder if Kaggle Grand Masters can do data science so that they can breathe unconsciously (I don&rsquo;t know because it&rsquo;s about other people).</p>
<p>But I hope this article helps someone.</p>
<p>Please comment anything you like!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a beginner who hasn&rsquo;t read the deciphers of data science yet, but I&rsquo;ll improve my skills little by little. It&rsquo;s in a slump, but Kaggle hasn&rsquo;t given up yet.</p>
<p>I would like to become a “true” data scientist and be able to write Qiita articles again.</p>
