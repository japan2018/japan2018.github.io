      <description>Today, it is announced that the extension of the emergency declaration will be announced, but for the time being, I would like to suppress the current situation nationwide.  Last time, we predicted the peak number of infections based on the SIR model, but this time we would like to use the SIHR model to predict the termination. .. This article is also written by an amateur, so please handle the contents at your own risk The SIHR model is an extension of the SIR model in order to reproduce the delay in the healing number, and is as follows.</description>

      <description>In the previous SEIR model, values such as $lp \fallingdotseq 1e^{-23}$ were obtained among the obtained parameters. In such a case, be careful because the digit cancellation or the differential equation may not work in the first place.  So, this time, I will change this part and try fitting with the simplest model.
