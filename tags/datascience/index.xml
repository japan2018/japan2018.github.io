      <description># I tried to display the condition of infection of corona on the heat map of seaborn  ##Purpose Visualize the spread of corona in each prefecture The goal is this. ##Method Use python&amp;rsquo;s seaborn. Click here for data on the number of infected people (up to 4/5). https://toyokeizai.net/sp/visual/tko/covid19/ Click here for prefecture data. https://gist.github.com/mugifly/d6e68a516de4a008687c Here is a summary of various things. https://github.com/kyasby/colona.git
Import library import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.</description>

      <title>I tried fitting exponential function and logistics function to the number of COVID-19 positive patients in Tokyo</title>

      <description>#Background  There was a person who fitted the trend of the number of COVID-19 infected people in the world to an exponential function and a logistic function and calculated the doubling period (https://github.com/aatishb/covid), so I cloned it. I applied it to the data on the number of patients published by Tokyo.
When it comes to Tokyo, the difference in the situation depending on the region is mixed into one distribution if it is national data, so it is easier to fit it to an ideal infection explosion model in a limited area.</description>

      <description>This article is a trend analysis of Twitter Data analysis. I will deepen this series later. Since this is my first article, I will explain this case in detail after briefly analyzing Twitter Data. Because Japanese is tight, I will change it to English. [Git Repository](https://github.com/Bing-Violet/Real-Time-insights-from-social-media/blob/master/notebook.ipynb)   ###Why Analyze Twitter Data? Twitter data analysis is used in a wide range of areas including but not restricted to analyzing the mentions of each political party in an election, detecting the reactions to the introduction of a new product, understanding the geographical scope of discussion of a news story.</description>
