      <description>![AirflowLogo.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/538885/a8895a6d-3950-c59f-420f-68f2b4e51a69.png)  The Issue For security purposes, sensitive connection and administrative information is encrypted with a Fernet key before being stored in Airflow&amp;rsquo;s backend database. This includes any passwords for your connection objects as well as service account keys for e.g. Google Cloud.
However, if you have built Airflow webserver as a containerized service, then every time you modify and rebuild your container you run the risk of invalidating your Fernet key and losing access to your connections.</description>
