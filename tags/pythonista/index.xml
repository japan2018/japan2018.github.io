      <description>#Introduction  The update is slow, but I&amp;rsquo;m still talking about the UI implementation of Pythonista! Continuing from the previous article, this time I will implement screen transitions. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t touched Pythonista yet, please read the following articles. (Since there is no story, you can understand this article without reading the following article if you have prerequisite knowledge)

      <description># at first  This is the 12/2 charge article for PyCon JP Advent Calendar 2016. There are other interesting articles, so if you are interested, please check it out. I have written Java in some places, but it may be wrong because it has been a while, so I hope you can read it while thinking about it.
Purpose As the subject says, I&amp;rsquo;ll share the mistakes I&amp;rsquo;ve made so that anyone reading this can make the transition from Javaer to Pythonista smoother.</description>
