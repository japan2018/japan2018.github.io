<pre><code>#Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>A list of institutions that support online medical care based on the spread of new coronavirus infection is available below.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/kenkou_iryou/iryou/rinsyo/index_00014.html">https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/kenkou_iryou/iryou/rinsyo/index_00014.html</a></p>
<p>Using this, I will create a process to retrieve what the nearby online medical treatment agency looks like.
We will also consider whether it is possible to use the PDF data provided by the government.</p>

<h1 id="explanation">Explanation</h1>
<h2 id="processing-flow">Processing flow</h2>
<p>(1) Obtain a PDF from the homepage of the list of compatible institutions for online medical care based on the spread of new coronavirus infection.</p>
<p>(2) Extract table information from PDF and convert it to JSON.
Please refer to the following page for the processing of this area.
・<a href="https://needtec.sakura.ne.jp/wod07672/2020/04/29/%e5%8e%9a%e7%94%9f%e5%8a%b4%e5%83%8d%e7%9c%81%e3%81%aepdf%e3%82%92csv%e3%82%84json%e3%81%ab%e5%a4%89%e6%8f%9b%e3%81%99%e3%82%8b/">Convert PDF of Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to CSV or JSON</a></p>
<p>(3) Combine the JSON of each prefecture into one JSON.</p>
<p>(4) Obtain the longitude and latitude from the address in JSON with the Yahoo! Geocoder API and record it.</p>
<p>(5) Store it in the database and display it on the screen based on that information.</p>
<h2 id="problems-when-extracting-tables-from-pdf">Problems when extracting tables from PDF.</h2>
<p>Actually, extracting the data in the table from PDF is quite troublesome.
There are libraries called <a href="https://tabula.technology/">tabula</a>and<a href="https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html">camelot</a>, but that&rsquo;s not enough. There is none.
Here we describe the problem we encountered using camelot.</p>
<h3 id="data-containing-long-characters-is-not-divided-properly">Data containing long characters is not divided properly.</h3>
<p>For example, suppose you have data that extends the contents of a cell as shown below.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/47856/17da7032-210e-d2ff-f096-3bd34e64b3e8.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>In this case, the phone number and URL are detected as a unit.
This time, as a method to deal with this problem, if there is no required item, we check the left and right cells to see if they are combined.
However, if a data string such as a postal code or phone number whose format has not been determined is targeted, it cannot be restored.</p>
<h3 id="memory-usage-issues">Memory usage issues</h3>
<p>camelot consumes a lot of memory, so it is better to process page by page.
I think this area will be helpful.
<a href="https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/issues/28">https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/issues/28</a></p>
<p>Also, due to the paper size problem of the data to be handled this time, it would be better to operate in a 64-bit process because even if each page is a 32-bit process, the memory becomes insufficient.</p>
<h3 id="the-dotted-line-cannot-be-detected">The dotted line cannot be detected.</h3>
<p>The following issue is completed, but camelot does not recognize well if you make a table with a dotted line.</p>
<p><strong>Detect dotted line #370</strong>
<a href="https://github.com/atlanhq/camelot/issues/370">https://github.com/atlanhq/camelot/issues/370</a></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how to fix this problem:
<a href="https://needtec.sakura.ne.jp/wod07672/2020/05/03/camelot%e3%81%a7%e7%82%b9%e7%b7%9a%e3%82%92%e5%ae%9f%e7%b7%9a%e3%81%a8%e3%81%97%e3%81%a6%e5%87%a6%e7%90%86%e3%81%99%e3%82%8b/">Process dotted line as solid line with camelot</a></p>
<h2 id="problems-with-pdf-of-the-list-of-supported-institutions">Problems with PDF of the list of supported institutions</h2>
<p>This is extremely troublesome, and I think that it is impossible to completely analyze PDF.</p>
<h3 id="size-of-paper">size of paper</h3>
<p>Since the size of the paper may be 1 m on each side, it takes time to process.
Also, it is impossible to process a common PDF after converting it to WORD because the size is too large.</p>
<h3 id="the-pdf-of-the-list-of-compatible-medical-institutions-is-updated-daily-and-its-url-also-changes">The PDF of the list of compatible medical institutions is updated daily, and its URL also changes.</h3>
<p>The PDF of the list of compatible medical institutions is updated daily, but the URL seems to change with each update.
For example, the URL of Tokyo is as follows.</p>
<p>As of April 28, 2020
<a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/000625693.pdf">https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/000625693.pdf</a></p>
<p>As of April 29, 2020
<a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/000626106.pdf">https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/000626106.pdf</a></p>
<p>Therefore, it is necessary to obtain the URL of the PDF from the link for online medical treatment based on the spread of new coronavirus infection.</p>
<h3 id="presence-or-absence-of-legend">Presence or absence of legend</h3>
<p>The legend may or may not be included in the first line of data.
There is a legend for Tokyo, but not for Hokkaido.</p>
<p>In other words, it is necessary to adjust the acquisition position of the first page data row for each prefecture.</p>
<h3 id="the-page-header-is-handled-differently-for-each-prefecture">The page header is handled differently for each prefecture.</h3>
<p>For example, compare PDFs from Tokyo and Ibaraki prefectures.
Tokyo includes the header on the second and subsequent pages, but not in Ibaraki prefecture.</p>
<p>In other words, it is necessary to adjust the acquisition position of the data rows on the second page and beyond for each prefecture.
Even in the same prefecture, this is not always the case.</p>
<p>In fact, Hokkaido had a header line after the second page until April.
Perhaps this can be guessed because the specification at the time of outputting the file sometimes changes.</p>
<h3 id="items-are-handled-differently-in-each-prefecture">Items are handled differently in each prefecture.</h3>
<p>For example, compare Hokkaido with Aichi and Yamanashi.</p>
<p><strong>Hokkaido</strong>
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/47856/abf2d8e3-e9de-870d-16dd-a1af97902c44.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p><strong>Aichi prefecture</strong>
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/47856/8574ff80-4224-6ce1-e21c-2c5ba9711891.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p><strong>Yamanashi Prefecture</strong>
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/47856/4daecc2e-ea88-b695-5b3a-29414cb6827c.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>The items in the columns may differ from prefecture to prefecture, and even if they are common items, the positions need to be adjusted.
Even in the same prefecture, items are not always the same. In fact, until April, Yamanashi Prefecture did not separate the lines of telephone consultations and online consultations.</p>
<h3 id="notation-blur">Notation blur</h3>
<p>There is an item &ldquo;whether or not medical treatment is performed using the telephone etc. for the first visit&rdquo;, but in most cases, ◯ or × (or blank) is written, but the description is blurred.
For example, the following annotations may be added.</p>
<pre><code>○
*Planned in the future
</code></pre><p>So it&rsquo;s not just about taking the first letter, but its expression is diverse.
At least at the moment, the following notation blurs exist.</p>
<p><strong>Expression indicating the existence of &ldquo;whether or not medical care is performed using the telephone for the first visit&rdquo;</strong></p>

<h3 id="other-problems">Other problems</h3>
<p>The actual PDF conversion result is as follows. There is a problem with the analysis program, but there are also errors in the PDF in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mima3/yakusyopdf/blob/master/20200503">https://github.com/mima3/yakusyopdf/blob/master/20200503</a></p>
<p>#Summary
This time, I converted the PDF published by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare so that it could be easily processed by a computer, and created a Web application using it.</p>
<p>Data can be automatically converted up to a certain point, but full automation is impossible because PDF is used. Also, even if you fix it by hand, it is frequently updated, so it is difficult.</p>
<p>**If you need at least accurate data and update frequently, you should avoid extracting data from PDF like this time. **</p>
<p>Also, if you are in a position to publish data, I would be grateful if you consider the following points.</p>
<p>-Can you publish other than PDF?
-When using data, Excel is better. PDFs look much the same but are much more difficult.
-Make sure to include the last update date for data that may be updated
-Avoid changing the format for each prefecture.
-Probably in good faith, I think it is easy to see, but it will be difficult for the machine to process.
-Unify expressions as much as possible.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all.</p>
