      <description>## Introduction  Things you should do when starting development with Django. Although it is not always necessary, it may be difficult to change it later, but it is better to set it in the initial stage. Create &amp;ldquo;setting directory name that contains settings.py&amp;rdquo; and extended user model.
There may be many other things, but as a memorandum at this stage.
Target of this article  People who have just completed all the Django tutorial materials and are about to start application creation People who want to organize basic knowledge about directory structure, projects, applications People who want to customize the user model a little  (1) Change the name of the setting directory when creating a project This is to make the project directory structure easier to understand.</description>

YouDev is a service that focuses on individual developers to let them know more about them (I want to know&amp;hellip;).
Even if the service is recognized, I think that the developers have not hit the spot, so individual developers may not only appeal the services released by themselves, but also the developers themselves. I created it.
I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for individual developers, so I&amp;rsquo;m an individual developer!</description>

The original article was written a long time ago (a year or so?), but now that I have enough knowledge, I thought I could make it a little better, so I decided to try it!
I will not talk about installing Docker in detail, so if you are interested, please check the original article! (Here)willhelp.)
Also, as a clear difference from the previous article, Django thinks as an API delivery server and assumes Vue.</description>

      <description>This article is from the 13th day of Django Advent Calendar 2019.  In this article, I would like to summarize Django&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Class-based Generic View&amp;rdquo; and its inheritance class relationships.
Premise I refer to and cite the official documentation of Django 3.0, which is the latest version at the time of writing this article.
What is a Class-Based Generic View? First, a &amp;ldquo;view&amp;rdquo; in Django is an encapsulation [^1] of logic that processes user requests and returns responses.</description>

      <description>2020/03/13 Modified slightly to match VSCode Version 1.43.0  Introduction A beginner yearned for the word debug, and learned that VS Code can actually do it, and tried setting it. The memorandum. I think that the advantage is that once you set it, you can enter the virtual environment and run the server just by pressing the Debug button. You can save yourself the trouble of going back and forth between the browser and Terminal and VS Code and entering source myenv/bin/activate or python manage.</description>

      <description>This is the 11th day of the Advent Calendar.  #Introduction Weekend/midnight Pythonista. It&amp;rsquo;s a person who flutters around pandas, numpy, scipy when collecting data at work. As a hobby, I often stumbled on static files when using Django, so I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to summarize the stumbling points and solutions for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know what they don&amp;rsquo;t understand. We would appreciate if you could point out any mistakes.</description>

      <description># Celebration! Django 3.0 released!  02/12/2019 Django 3.0 has been released. Django 1.0 was released in 2008 and 2.0 was released in December 2017. And 3.0 was released on 12/2 of this year. The upgrade from 1 to 2 took about 10 years, but from 2 to 3 it took less than 2 years, which is a surprising sense of speed. On the other hand, what have I been doing over the last two years?</description>

      <guid>https://memotut.com/asynchronous-processing-implementation-in-django-celery-redis-ded69/</guid>
      <description>#About this article  I think that asynchronous processing is essential when creating a web application with Django, and I would like to introduce its introduction with examples. The software to use is Celery(celery), ・About asynchronous processing by django+Celery ・How to implement asynchronous processing with Django I implemented it by referring to the article around here.
##environment ・Python 3.6.8 ・Django 2.2.7 ・CentOS7
What is asynchronous processing? Actually, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know the word asynchronous processing until I actually encountered the problem.</description>

      <description>#Foreword  Django 3.0 was officially released 3 days ago. Release node link I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in the addition of ASGI support, among many changes, I want to actually use it. :sunny:
Note: What is ASGI?:briefcase: ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is the spiritual successor to WSGI and aims to provide a standard interface between asynchronous-enabled Python web servers, frameworks, and applications. While WSGI provided the standard for synchronous Python apps, ASGI provides both asynchronous and synchronous apps with a backwards-compatible implementation of WSGI and multiple servers and application frameworks.</description>

      <description>This article is the 5th day of [Django Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/django).  #Introduction Django&amp;rsquo;s ORM can issue sufficient queries for development by making full use of select_related, prefetch_related, Preftch, Q object, etc.
However, there are some things that cannot be done, and there are cases where you have to write raw SQL. For example, when multiple indexes are pasted, USE_IDNEX to specify the index you want to use, IGNORE_INDEX to specify the index you do not want to use, etc.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  This article is from Django Advent Calendar 2019. The target audience is for those who are new to Django.
The previous article was about @yuu-eguci&amp;rsquo;s 500 error. https://qiita.com/yuu-eguci/items/a1e4b0a2f238d5ccc985
This article is about trying to execute Spotify API with Django.
Advance preparation I need to create a user account for Spotify, but the following article by Class Method is very helpful. https://dev.classmethod.jp/etc/about-using-of-spotify-api/
If you want to execute the sample code of the article, please download the chart data in CSV format from the following.</description>

      <description>It seems that there are various plugins when I check the admin site of Django.  Since I wanted to import/export the data of the management screen in a format such as CSV, I checked it and it was easy with django-import-export. A memorandum at that time.
Install First install with pip
$ pip install django-import-export Configuration Add import_export to INSTALLED_APPS
# settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = ( ... &amp;#39;import_export&amp;#39;, ) Added to admin.</description>

(I&amp;rsquo;m sorry if you change the DB from the default sqlite&amp;hellip;

      <description>#Purpose  From an acquaintance who read the article the other day &amp;ldquo;So, if you already have a DB in use, can you attach Django later?&amp;rdquo; There was an arbitrary request, so I also verified it.
If you say from the conclusion, it was possible. Moreover, it is simple. Obviously, it seems that the supported database products and versions are somewhat limited. This area may be helpful.
#manner Reuse the application from the last article, but delete the database side tables.</description>

      <description>It seems that a tool called Sourcetrail has been released and it seems interesting, so I tried it.  There was an article you have already touched, but it is charming. Ubuntu.
I used it, and the big repository that I can think of was Django, so I will try it with a combination of Python and Django.
Install SourceTrail You can download it from Sourcetrail(GitHub) Release Page. Download 64-bit Linux tar file</description>

      <description>This is my first time joining the Advent Calendar. Thank you.  Overview My hobby is Pythonista. This year I introduced to Django and made a website. This time, for the same Django beginner as I am, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to write a rough guide to how to get rid of things that will bother you and make you cry. It is Server Error (500).
At this time, try to display the error content on the screen even temporarily, output a log, or notify Slack of the error content.</description>

Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about changing jobs, and I&amp;rsquo;m studying programming to make it appeal to me. It&amp;rsquo;s not so appealing to say that you&amp;rsquo;re just studying with your mouth, so I made a simple web app with Python and Django, built it on AWS, and released the source to Github.
This time, I would like to explain the program (Python) I wrote myself, which also serves as an output for the fixation of knowledge within me.</description>
