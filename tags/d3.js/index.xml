      <description>#Introduction  On the evening of March 30, 2020, rumors spread that the government would issue an emergency declaration on April 1 and lockdown the city on the next two days.
In FIJ (Fact Check Initiative), which promotes the spread of fact check in Japan, this issue is taken as one of the unreliable information.

Python There seem to be various ways to draw a tree structure in Python, and the first thing I can think of is networkxor[graphviz].AlthoughIuseagraphlibrarysuchas(https://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), I think that it is difficult to express elaborately because it is a library intended to analyze the graph structure in the first place.</description>
