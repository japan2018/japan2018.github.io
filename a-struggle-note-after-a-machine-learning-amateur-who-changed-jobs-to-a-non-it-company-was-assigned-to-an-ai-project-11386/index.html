</code></pre>
<p>This article is the 8th day of <a href="https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/machine-learning-01">How I learned machine learning by Nikkei xTECH Business AI â‘¡ Advent Calendar 2019</a>.
We hope that it will be helpful for those who are new to the market.</p>
<h2 id="programming-experience">Programming experience</h2>
<ul>
<li>School days (robot engineering, fluid mechanics):
<ul>
<li>:new: C/C++; embedded, computational fluid dynamics, research tools</li>
<li>:new: Matlab; A little in modern control theory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Previous job (ADAS):
<ul>
<li>C/C++; embedded, in-house tool</li>
<li>:new: Python; Algorithm prototyping and data organization *Not related to AI</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current position (construction and civil engineering construction management):
<ul>
<li>C++; built-in</li>
<li>Python; Machine Learning/Deep Learning</li>
<li>:new: JavaScript (Node.js, GoogleAppsScript), HTML, CSS; Internal tool</li>
<li>:new: Julia; I am touching with interest</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I studied C/C++ and Matlab in university classes, and Python <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">Sololearn</a>.
For JavaScript and HTML, I used the standard <a href="https://prog-8.com/languages">Progate-san</a> to go through the grammar and then read the language reference.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-started-learning-machine-learning">How I started learning machine learning</h2>
<p>When asked about programming experience during the current job interview and lightened the story of Python,
&ldquo;Hona, Yeah! Ayana!&rdquo;
have become. With this reaction, I joined the company with an unpleasant feeling, and then was assigned to a new project for business development utilizing AI. It is danced to the lie-like equation of Python = AI. Even though I wrote Python, I was a layman in machine learning, so I took this opportunity to start studying.
*The score of general object recognition has been significantly updated by using Deep Learning! Since I was talking about when I was a student, I always had an interest in technology.</p>
<p>[2019/12/09 edit]
I prepared the material on an ambiguous memory base, as if I saw an article by Mr. Mas<em>Door</em>Rise, but it was completely different from my memory. I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<h1 id="learning-method">Learning method</h1>
<p>I will enumerate them in the order in which they put their hands out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Participate in paid seminars</li>
<li>Participate in study sessions</li>
<li>Buy books</li>
<li>Kaggle Kernel search</li>
<li>Challenge the competition with SIGNATE</li>
</ul>
<p>I rate myself as not good at reading books and learning (especially when learning new things), so I was thinking of attending seminars and study sessions first. Also, since the assigned project was a regression prediction of time series data, the content was narrowed down to the time series data relationship rather than the image processing relationship.</p>
<h2 id="participating-seminar">Participating seminar</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nikkeibp.co.jp/seminar/atcl/dk/ne190311/">Introduction to machine learning and deep learning for engineers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nikkeibp.co.jp/seminar/atcl/dk/ne190422s/">Statistical machine learning and deep learning application for engineers (4 times in total)</a>
*The link is for 2019, but I participated in 2018.</li>
</ul>
<p>*** It&rsquo;s not about selling Nikkei-san&rsquo;s aphrodisiac ***, at this time the concept of AI = image processing is overwhelming the world, and seminars centered on time series data are really valuable. did. It&rsquo;s really MNIST or Semantic Segmentation&hellip; (I&rsquo;m completely learning with tasks, so the situation is different, so I think it&rsquo;s a good theme for beginners.)</p>
<p>As for the content of the seminar, I was able to learn from the basics of machine learning and deep learning (that is, regression and classification are different things). I learned here that the CNN in the image system and the RNN in the regression system take the basic form, and new forms such as the generation system are emerging. I think that actually moving the hand to calculate is a good experience to know the contents of the process. <del>I was surprised that many of the participants could not calculate the matrix</del></p>
<p>The main purpose of the story of the time series, which was the original purpose, was to detect abnormalities in machine tools. Although it did not exactly match my content, the teacher took time after the lecture and gave me a lot of valuable advice.</p>
<p>Another thing I feel is that you don&rsquo;t ask much questions. I don&rsquo;t know if I already knew it or I didn&rsquo;t understand it because I didn&rsquo;t understand it, but I was able to spend most of the time asking questions, so I was happy. Since you pay so much to participate, those who have knowledge will win.</p>
<h2 id="study-session-you-participated-in">Study session you participated in</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://to-kei.connpass.com/">Introduction to Python Time Series-Statistics for All Humankind</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Participating here as there is no knowledge of how to handle time series data (trends, seasons, etc.). We use <a href="https://connpass.com/">connpass</a>and<a href="https://techplay.jp/">TECHPLAY</a>tosearchforstudysessions.Inadditiontotheoreticallearning,<a href="https://leapmind.io/">LeapMind</a>sponsoredby<a href="https://edls.leapmind.io/">EdgeDeepLearningSummit2019</a> Was also used.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t participated in it yet, but there are many data pre-processing research groups and mokumoku groups that seem interesting, so I would like to increase the number of participants.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="kaggle-kernel-search">Kaggle Kernel Search</h2>
<p>I knew the competition existed, but during the time I was studying, I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of trying it myself, so I focused on <strong>reading the kernel</strong>. As a point to read, I picked up the time series/regression prediction related topics as the theme of the competition, and I was looking at what kind of process is being taken when facing the technique and task of kneading the data of other people. It was It&rsquo;s more primitive than an algorithm. When I faced the data, I was trying to figure out what kind of procedure to take (where to see what to do?) What I felt here was that although I participated in study sessions and read books, such as <strong>Interpretation of statistics for variables I had,</strong> I still don&rsquo;t know much. I felt that there was no foundation before saying <strong>machine learning or deep learning</strong>. I will talk about it in the competition below, but I still feel it.</p>
<h2 id="challenge-the-competition-with-signate">Challenge the competition with SIGNATE</h2>
<p>The competition itself was not Kaggle, but domestic <a href="https://signate.jp/">SIGNATE-san</a>.Thisisquiterecent,anditisTakeda&rsquo;s<a href="https://signate.jp/competitions/168">AIDrugDiscovery:PharmacokineticParameterPrediction</a>.Inmanyimageclassificationandimagegenerationcompetitions,drugdiscoverycompetitionsand<a href="https://signate.jp/competitions/162">landcompetitions</a> were valuable regression problems.</p>
<p>The first submission of the memorable first competition of the life was a start because I was unable to measure due to a CSV file format error and I was crushed by my nose &hellip;w After that, I corrected the format and re-submitted, it became a sounding score It was. Eventually, the rankings have settled down as shown below.</p>
<img width="991" alt="Screenshots 2019-12-04 22.12.45.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/131278/0d10b106-fe3e-659a-42f4-6a099a8b9aa9.png">
<p>The results aren&rsquo;t very good, but I think what I got was great.
What I strongly felt in this competition was the small number of data pre-processing draws. We implemented one-hot encoding of categorical variables and implemented mandatory ones such as ~, but &ldquo;Is there something between these variables?&rdquo; As for the feature quantity generation, it was particularly weak. The number of posts is 4, but I was stuck with **&ldquo;What should I do from now on&rdquo; **. As mentioned in the books I want to buy, I think that the data analysis technology that wins at Kaggle is completely necessary for me.</p>
<p>Also, as with programming itself, I think it&rsquo;s best to learn with clear guidelines**. If you are a person who does not have an assigned project as a premise like me and you are going to study, I think that the guideline (task) is prepared **Competition is a very meaningful environment** .. It is recommended that if you try to focus, it will inevitably start collecting knowledge about tasks, and it will be a starting point to expand your knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="present-and-futureit-is-a-regression-problem-project-that-was-assigned-after-joining-the-company-but-the-variables-were-made-dimensionless-and-anonymous-and-the-time-stamp-was-re-assigned-to-articlehttpsqiitacomnyanko-boxitemsa6f50e28383a5bd0a432iampleasereadifyoulikewehavebeenusingtwotypesofmodelslstmfullcombinationmodelof2layersandxgboostbuttheproblemthattheoutputofthemodelistheoutputoftheinputlstmfortimeseriesprediction-kerasissueshttpsgithubcomkeras-teamkerasissues2856-and-i-am-having-a-hard-time-people-with-knowledge-are-very-pleased-to-give-us-advice">Present and futureIt is a regression problem project that was assigned after joining the company, but the variables were made dimensionless and anonymous, and the time stamp was re-assigned to <a href="https://qiita.com/nyanko-box/items/a6f50e28383a5bd0a432">Article</a>.Iam.Pleasereadifyoulike.Wehavebeenusingtwotypesofmodels,LSTM+fullcombinationmodelof2layersandXGBoost,buttheproblemthattheoutputofthemodelistheoutputoftheinput<a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/2856">(LSTMfortimeseriesprediction-kerasissues)</a> and I am having a hard time&hellip; People with knowledge are very pleased to give us advice.</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the know-how of data preprocessing and feature generation is very important, and I am not enough at present. So it is very helpful for the famous Kaggler people to publish blogs and books and to be active in Kernel. It provides us with what we have experienced so far.</p>
<p>In addition, my work is a regression problem, so the content I have learned is specialized in regression. Therefore, it is safe to say that there are almost no image-related methods or preprocessing. I wonder if it&rsquo;ll work if I work with CNN? I feel like that. I don&rsquo;t currently have a project related to image-related (anomaly detection or classification), but I think I can use it for future work and I would like to learn. We will also challenge the competition of image themes that have been through until now.</p>
<p>First of all, Kaggle book.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who has read this far.
I am sorry that it is almost a sentence and it is a long sentence.</p>
<p>It is said that AI is entering a period of disillusionment, but I think the needs of engineers will continue to increase. Also, we human beings <em>will gradually lose market value with age</em>*, so I think it is good to increase what we can do in that sense.</p>
<p>We hope this article will serve as a reference for those who are new to the market. (Second time at the beginning)</p>
