      <description>In the field of numerical calculation, there have been simulations of free-moving particles and collective movements of Brownian particles in the past.  This time, I will apply this to a simulation of coronavirus infection. There is PSO as a similar simulation, but this time I referred to these python codes. 【reference】 ・Particle swarm optimization (PSO) parameters ・Saved particle swarm optimization (PSO)
what you did ・Code explanation ・Dependence on infection rate ・Dependence on particle density ・Particle motion dependence</description>

      <description>[Notice] [Sequel](https://qiita.com/akeyhero/items/a8aa2d3db2c32c867ff6) is used to determine the lethality rate of COVID-19.  Purpose  Verify if COVID-19&amp;rsquo;s lethality is really high Try the stochastic programming language Stan  What is a probabilistic programming language? It is a programming language that solves nicely by describing statistical relationships (models). As an implementation, it seems to sample by Markov chain Monte Carlo method.
It is not a replacement for the procedural programming language because it has a completely different role and method.</description>

      <description># at first  I am not an infectious disease specialist, so please read it after understanding.
The new corona pneumonia (Covid-19) that occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China from December 2019 has spread to Japan and the number of infected people is increasing. I am interested in how the number of infected people in Japan will increase in the future. Therefore, I searched for articles on infection prediction models. Infection models have already been announced from all over the world, but parameters such as the infection rate and the isolation rate greatly affect the accuracy when predicting with an infection model.</description>

      <description>#1.First of all  The number of new corona pneumonia (Covid-19) that occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 is increasing in Japan. Understanding how infectious diseases such as influenza, AIDS, and SARS spread through human populations through the process of confirming the effects of health policies such as setting vaccinations and isolation of infected persons. Is also important. In the previous article, I explained the SIR model, but I will introduce the SEIR model that considers the latency of infectious diseases.</description>

      <description>#1. At the beginning  The number of people infected with the new coronavirus (Convid-19) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 in Japan is increasing. Understanding how wrestling infectious diseases such as influenza, AIDS, and SARS spread in human populations is essential to confirm the effects of health policies such as setting vaccinations and isolating infected people. Is also important. Here, we will introduce the SIR model, which is the basis of the infectious disease mathematical prediction model, and the process of calculating this model in Python.</description>
