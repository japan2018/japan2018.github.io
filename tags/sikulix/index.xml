      <description>It is called business automation, but there are many tools for automation. You mean, &amp;quot;You don&#39;t have to use that special tool for that task!?&amp;quot; So, I tried to categorize by business type, environment, user type, etc.  1. Automation of core operations (accounting, HR, CRM, ERP, etc.) RPA recommendation level: ☆☆☆☆☆
Don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to introduce packaged software for human resources, salary, management accounting, supply chain, cost accounting, CRM, etc. for basic business as a company independent of the industry and automation of business unique to the industry.</description>
