      <description>[Language processing 100 knocks 2020 version](https://nlp100.github.io/ja/) has been published, so I will solve it at this opportunity.  It&amp;rsquo;s a copy of my own jupyter notebook in markdown, so the explanation is less. I hope that it will be a little reference, and I also posted to Qiita what I plan to put together on a blog and GitHub. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the teachers who can provide such wonderful teaching materials.</description>

      <description>This article is for people who want to get started with natural language processing in Python, with little knowledge of C but little of Python. We are aiming for the shortest route that can solve Chapter 1 of [Language Processing 100 Knock 2015](http://www.cl.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/nlp100/) which is famous as an introduction to natural language processing. ..  (4/8 postscript, Chapter 1 is the same for 2020 version)
This Qiita already has a lot of articles about 100 knocks, but I thought that it might be difficult for beginners to learn Python, so I wrote this article.</description>

Assumptions  Environment -Link of Dockerfile(includingunrelatedones) Ability -I have touched mecab and gensim without knowing anything How to solve -For the time being, I solved it myself, and I checked the question every 10 questions by annoying -There is also a part to put two answers Excuse -Correction of wrong answer noticed during compilation is not in time Thanks -It is very appreciated as a self-taught person who goes through the darkness to release these teaching materials  Reflection I was re-reading the code myself to draw this article, so it was a pseudo code review</description>

      <description>## 02. “Patrol Car” + “Taxi” = “Pattokka See”  Get the character string &amp;ldquo;Patto Kukashi&amp;rdquo; by alternately connecting the letters &amp;ldquo;Patrol Car&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Taxi&amp;rdquo; from the beginning.
###Go
package main import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; ) func main() { var p1 string = &amp;#34;police car&amp;#34;; var p2 string = &amp;#34;Taxi&amp;#34;; var result string; // make the character array p1s := strings.Split(p1,&amp;#34;&amp;#34;); p2s := strings.Split(p2,&amp;#34;&amp;#34;); // Array number loop (match with &amp;#34;patrol car&amp;#34; because it has the same number of characters.</description>
