<p>This qualification was taken from <a href="https://qiita.com/y-vectorfield/items/36fc6d773f01ae33cd2c">past article</a>&lsquo;sarticleby[@kazzy0099]<a href="Ifounditathttps://qiita.com/kazzy0099/items/d423491bda6fedbce196">[scheduledupdate]Datascience/machinelearningrelatedqualificationsummary</a> and took the test. It will be updated from time to time. I look forward to future updates.</p>
<h1 id="motivation-for-taking-the-exam">Motivation for taking the exam</h1>
<p>I took the exam with the following motives.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am interested in machine learning and deep learning, so I am studying
*Because I want to take the E qualification in the future
*Because I thought that taking the qualification that put the spotlight on the implementation would strengthen the implementation ability</li>
<li>Since my hobby is qualification, etc&hellip;</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>An article with a schematic diagram of the positioning of the test was posted on <a href="http://kentei.ai/">http://kentei.ai/</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/469079/c876b3fd-c9c9-eb09-9c36-4eb60557e09e.jpeg" alt="AIexam.jpg"></p>
<p>It is possible that grades other than grade A will be created in the future, but this time we were looking for grade A only. Also, this test is a <font color="RED">test that you can take on your home PC</font>. There will be 60 questions in total, 20 in each of the fields of mathematics, programming, and deep learning. The test time is 60 minutes, so you cannot afford to think carefully. Regarding the passing score, it seems that the total points have to reach the passing score announced at each test. The examination fee is JPY 3,500. Recently, there are many qualification examinations for high-priced examination fees, so the price is conscientious. (Only my opinion)</p>
<p>:warning: <font color="RED"> AI implementation certification Passed A grade = E certification is not qualified. As a separate eligibility requirement, you must take <a href="https://www.jdla.org/certificate/engineer/#certificate_No04">JDLA certified training</a>. </font></p>
<h1 id="2020330-addition-about-passing-rate-and-passing-score">2020/3/30 Addition About passing rate and passing score</h1>
<p><a href="http://kentei.ai/info/1319">Report: AI implementation test [A grade] 1st implementation result</a>, the pass rate is about 80%. I can&rsquo;t say for sure because the passing score has not been announced, but as far as the average score is concerned, I think that I want 80% or more.</p>
<h1 id="test-range">Test range</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://kentei.ai/introduction/subjecttrend">Exam Sample</a> also serves as the scope of the exam. There is also a reference to the composition ratio of all 60 questions.</p>
<h1 id="exam-preparation">Exam preparation</h1>
<p>I would like to introduce the teaching materials that were actually used for the exam preparation. I couldn&rsquo;t say exactly because the study period was intermittent, but if you have some knowledge about neural networks and deep learning, I think that you can make two laps of the official teaching material video in about two weeks.</p>
<p>:warning: If you want to pass from zero knowledge, you will need a certain learning period. (Especially math)
:warning: I&rsquo;m a science student, and NN and Deep Learning are a bit of a bit of knowledge in lessons and research during my institute.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://kentei.ai/introduction/howto">http://kentei.ai/introduction/howto</a></p>
<p>Bambi β-Taurus (Section 1 Basic)
If you want to start from the basics of Python or operating a personal computer, start here. Learn how to use Numpy and Matplotlib, libraries required for drawing functions and numerical calculations required for neural networks.</p>
<p>Bambi β-Gemini (Section 2 Basic)
The basics of neural network forward propagation start here.</p>
<p>Bambi β-Cancer 1 (Section 3 Advanced Edition)
Back propagation of neural networks. If you step up to this point, beginners will graduate.</p>
<p>★Bambi β-Cancer2 (Section3 Advanced Edition)
Chain rule of neural network. If you understand this, you are an intermediate person.</p>
<p>Bambi β-Leo (Section 4 Advanced Edition)
It is an update-type implementation that introduces the middle tier. The source code will also be distributed, so please move your hands and &ldquo;learn&rdquo;. If you can do this, you will be a very good person.</p>
<p>Bambi β-Virgo 1 (Section 4 application)
Implement deep learning with handwritten character data. Intermediate students will graduate if this is possible. You can reach the level where you can learn deep learning even with this self-study.</p>
<p>★ Bambiβ-Virgo2 (Section5 Advanced Edition) ← <font color="RED">Section5 content is out of the test range, but it is interesting content, so it is worth working on</font>
Implement deep learning with handwritten character data. Intermediate students will graduate if this is possible. You can reach the level where you can learn deep learning even with this self-study. We will implement it in 5 languages and frameworks using exchange data as an example. (Chainer,NumPy,PyTorch,TensorFlow,Keras) The concept of dealing with time series called RNN has appeared in the exchange data, and it goes beyond the world of Bambi and enters the advanced range.</p>

<p>When I read it again after doing the official teaching material, I tried to understand how this book is tedious to the comprehension of the explanation of the logic and logic, and not to lose the rigor. I realized once again that it is an excellent book that explains. This book is a Japanese translation, so I would like to read the original.</p>
<h1 id="impressions-of-actually-taking-the-test">Impressions of actually taking the test</h1>
<p>The actual exam is 20 questions in order of math, programming, and AI. The first mathematics primarily requires knowledge of linear algebra. At first, it may be annoying, but since it is a test that you do not have time to think carefully about 60 questions in 60 minutes and solve it, it is necessary to cleanly postpone calculation problems that may take time or throw it away Will be. In programming problems, there were scikit-learn in the range, so it was given at a fairly high rate. The AI part was similar to the official teaching material. (I love the gradient descent method) E It may be because it is a qualification that is conscious of test preparation, but as I mentioned in the test page, I strongly got the impression that it is an implementation and reasoning-oriented test. After that, it is better to prepare the paper and pen so that you can write the calculation problem by hand and solve it. I have taken numerous qualification exams so far, but this is the first exam I take at home. It may be the perfect format for today&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>@PoppeDwarf&rsquo;s article <a href="https://qiita.com/PoppeDwarf/items/bf548f53b92ed982867f">impression and reminder of AI implementation test</a> was posted. The writer of this article also remarks about the same thing as me.:warning: An e-mail requesting pre-login to the test system and operation confirmation will be sent several days before the test date. It is recommended that you log in and check if it works properly in advance. In addition, prior to that, Study-AI suddenly sent the learning content usage page and login information <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, which is the login information for the test system. </font>Since this time, I hesitated to open it because I thought it was spam at first.</p>
<p>#Summary
I have summarized the AI implementation test A class. I think that this exam was very meaningful in that I was able to reconfirm that my understanding was weak after re-learning about Neural Network this time. I would like to continue to study the latest topics such as machine learning, deep learning, quantum computers whose theory is difficult to understand and quantum machine learning. This article is the 20th article posted since last August. I would like to continue to actively disseminate information.</p>
<h1 id="2020413-postscript-i-received-a-pass-certificate">2020/4/13 Postscript I received a pass certificate</h1>
<p>I received a pass certificate. He is awarded the title of Deep Learning Implementer. It may be the first time in my life that I got a qualification and got a title.</p>

<p>Two types of pass logos were also attached, so I decided to replace the Qiita icon with the pass logo image from today.</p>
