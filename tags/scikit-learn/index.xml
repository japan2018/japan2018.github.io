      <description>#1. Purpose  If you want to do machine learning, anyone can use scikit-learn etc. to implement it relatively easily. However, in order to achieve results at work or to improve your level, The explanation &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand the background but I got this result&amp;rdquo; clearly shows the weakness.
In this article, the purpose of ** is 2-3, &amp;ldquo;I will use scikit-learn first because the theory is good,&amp;rdquo; and 4 and &amp;ldquo;understand the background from mathematics&amp;rdquo; **.</description>

      <description>Currently (2020/03/03), all the teaching materials of N prep schools are released free of charge due to the suspension of elementary and junior high school due to the spread of COVID-19 infection. It is said that I am also working on &amp;quot;Introduction to machine learning&amp;quot;, but a little trouble occurred in &amp;quot;12. How to handle missing values&amp;quot;.  error

      <description>This article is from the 15th day of the Fujitsu Systems Web Technology Advent Calendar.  (Promise) The content of this article is my own opinion and does not represent the organization to which I belong.
Introduction In this article, we use scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library. I have summarized the procedure and the result when I tried handwriting recognition of runes **. While the advent calendars of this Advent Calendar are putting in great features and know-how that are likely to be useful for actual work, However, I made something that was just fun for me, and I cannot help being so enthusiastic.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Hello everyone.
Do you use a matching app? ! I feel good as one of those who have recently matched with a matching app.
By the way, the matching app I was using was able to refer to the data of other popular members. (Probably people who have received more than 100 like are displayed.)
When I saw it, I was disappointed.
&amp;ldquo;Like, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get 100&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; ** &amp;ldquo;I want to be a man who exceeds 100&amp;rdquo; **</description>

 4.1. Pipeline and FeatureUnion: Estimator combination 4.1.1. Pipeline: Chain estimation Pipeline can be used to combine multiple estimators into one. I can do it. It is convenient because the steps that process the data, such as feature selection, normalization, and classification, are often fixed. The pipeline serves two purposes here.
-Convenience: To fit the whole sequence of estimators, just call fit and predict the data once.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  When I was looking for something good as an example of using open data, I found that the water level data was published on the site of Data City Sabae, so I tried machine learning using it. It was

      <description>I tried to identify the voice actor&#39;s voice in machine learning practice. Make a note of the procedure.  ###Thing you want to do First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s learn the voice actors&amp;rsquo; original voices (voices such as radio), and check how accurately they can be identified by including the original voices as test data. Next, I would like to test whether the voices of anime can be predicted from the voice actors&amp;rsquo; original voices.</description>
