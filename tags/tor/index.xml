      <description>## Note  :warning: This article does not recommend scraping with Tor.
Scraping is basically okay, but if you are prohibited by the terms of use of the target site or if you put an excessive load on the server of the target site, you may be punished.
What is Tor It is a technology that anonymizes the connection route. Theoretically, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to determine who accessed using Tor.
Execution environment Homebrew 2.</description>

      <description>I was writing because I was thinking of scraping with python,  If the same IP address is accessed for a certain period of time, the access will be denied for a while. When a site like this appears, it may not be possible to scrape well, so I will try to impersonate the IP address and scrape.
However, since the operation is confirmed only for macOS, I think that the method is a little different especially for windows.</description>
