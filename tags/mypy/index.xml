      <description>## Overview  Type hints added in PEP484 since Python 3.5. I think that it can be applied to ndarray of numpy,anditisatypehintstaticchecktoolmypy, and the results of the wp investigation, such as dealing with third party modules.
Conclusion In conclusion, type hint checking of numpy.ndarray using mypy is possible using numpy-stubs. However, as of now (January 2020), mypy check cannot be performed by specifying the dtype and shape of ndarray. On the other hand, if you want to add type hints including dtype and shape as annotations for readability, the option to use nptyping seems good.</description>

      <description>I had been writing TypeScript for about a year, but I started to work on Python3 for about a month.  Although Python is simple and fun, there are places that I inherited from other people, and it is hard to develop and have no type.
The hardest part is reading the code, and what does this function return? Do not know at first glance what this variable contains. &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;There is no type as a document.</description>
