<pre><code>This article is about how I learned machine learning by Nikkei xTECH Business AI② Advent Calendar 2019 __.
</code></pre>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the steps that have taken a slightly different step from the general approach to learning machine learning. I would be happy if it could be used as a reference for as many people as possible.
I usually write for individual blogs, and I was warmly thinking about writing on my blog, but I thought it was a great opportunity, so I posted it on __qiita for the first time __.
I finished writing the article and reviewed the whole article, but this article is completely read. Almost no my achievements or code</p>
<h2 id="history-of-brief-self-introduction-and-machine-learning">History of brief self-introduction and machine learning</h2>
<p>I just wanted to tell you the details, so I wrote it. Please read it roughly</p>
<p>Currently a 23 year old man. I am in the position of a so-called new graduate. When I was an undergraduate student, I majored in civil engineering and architecture, but I was completely frustrated, and while searching for something interesting, I chose programming, learned by myself, and gained experience as an intern at a company. Stuffed
I have recognized that I have acquired skills to some extent, and from this year I am working as an engineer (mainly web) in Nagoya.
<img width="500" alt="IMG_5467.JPG" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/231852/0d12d2be-77f9-d7cc-91d4-326c820362bf.jpeg">
(A model I made when I was an undergraduate student. It conveys the lack of sense&hellip;)</p>
<p>To tell the truth, my current workplace is a company that has been an intern since I was an undergraduate student. It is a company that is carrying out parallel development of artificial intelligence and the web, which is rare in Nagoya. However, at the time when I was an intern,</p>
<ul>
<li>Web development is busy</li>
<li>Only one person has an understanding of machine learning</li>
</ul>
<p>It was the situation. However, on the other hand, the number of consultations on machine learning is increasing every day, and the policy has been decided that __&ldquo;Someone has to learn machine learning newly~&rdquo;. The web development team didn&rsquo;t have time to devote themselves to learning machine learning, and they started to talk to themselves, “Do you want to study machine learning?” __.</p>
<p>For the time being, I could write <code>python3 series''` at that time (I was frustrated by the C language that even cats can understand when I was a junior high school student), so I knew at least the word machine learning. I also knew that it was because of machine learning that pushed up the annual income ranking. The feeling that &quot;I'm doing </code>python```, so isn&rsquo;t machine learning a bit too much?&rdquo; and my past, when I was a junior high school student, hated mathematics because I had many miscalculations. I was not able to say, but when I noticed that I was supposed to do machine learning (Hey</p>
<p>By the way, it is the following impure reason that I chose <code>python</code> for learning at that time</p>
<ul>
<li>The grammar is simple and easy to write</li>
<li>It seems that it is the most language in the annual income ranking &lt;- This was big</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-first-step-to-machine-learning">The first step to machine learning</h2>
<h3 id="challenge-the-kaggle-tutorial">Challenge the kaggle tutorial</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sticky first step, but first I decided to try the <code>kaggle</code> Titanic tutorial. It should have been this kind of place</p>
<ul>
<li>Touch and understand the outline of machine learning</li>
<li>Understand the whole flow when dealing with machine learning</li>
<li>Understand what machine learning can do (output)</li>
</ul>
<p>While referring to articles such as blogs, I was able to confirm what was going on for the time being.
So that&rsquo;s it. I think I was able to achieve the goal that such results would be output if I trained the data using machine learning, but I didn&rsquo;t find this work interesting at all. __
Of course, most of the code is round and round, but there are a lot of work-related processes (such as filling in missing values), and even when choosing a machine learning model, <code>sk-learn`` Installing `` with </code>pip<code>and just</code>import``` the model I wanted</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve finished making all the interesting places, and then I just put them side by side and I felt like I was playing a huge LEGO with no 10 blocks.</p>
<h3 id="temporary-tensorflow">Temporary TensorFlow</h3>
<p>Next I decided to implement the <code>DeepLearning</code> model myself. The level of understanding is about the level of machine learning. At that time, I didn&rsquo;t understand that there was a tutorial in the framework documentation, so I bought this one. Impulse buying at a bookstore. It was thin enough and I read it while writing the code in about two weeks. There was a chapter called 4 hours using GPU on the way, so I went through it.</p>

<p>Starting with simple image classification of <code>mnist</code>, touching <code>CNN</code>, <code>RNN</code>, making distributed expression with <code>Word2vec</code>&hellip; The work that is the basis of the work of I was touched in this one book
The minimum mathematical formula was described, and it was a book intended to move the hand, so I personally enjoyed reading it. On the other hand, there are some incomprehensible words such as <code>Layer</code>, <code>loss function</code>, <code>gradient descent method</code>, so what is more important in the basic knowledge and model? I think that it is necessary to acquire theoretical knowledge such as whether something is happening, so I decided the next learning method</p>
<p>Up to this point, we have been moving our hands to check the output and intuitively understand machine learning.</p>
<h2 id="reading-books">Reading books</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve roughly read the popular machine learning books about O&rsquo;Reilly. From 0 to 1 and 2, I spent most of my reading time, so I think I could understand it quite a bit, and the contents were very easy to understand. Above all, according to the title, it was my nature to start from scratch. __
On the other hand, not all books could be read through, and some were frustrated. Even though I have read through the rest, there are things that are not left as current knowledge. What I think it was a failure now is that I was reading the same subject in multiple books. I wasted a lot of time with this book, with this book, with this book, etc., and it became complicated to understand, so it is important to manage the number, but to choose That was also important</p>
<p>If you want to select it as the first book from now on</p>
<ul>
<li>For non-engineers -&gt; Introduction to machine learning From Boltzmann machine learning to deep learning</li>
<li>Engineers -&gt; Deep Learning made from scratch</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to recommend either</p>
<h3 id="should-i-move-hands-or-learn-theory">Should I move hands or learn theory?</h3>
<p>I think you like it completely. I entered from theory, and since I did not have a successful experience of saying something well, I tried to move the hand first, and learned what I did not understand afterwards. I&rsquo;m sure there are people who are good at the opposite. He was studying theoretical physics of his colleague and he is completely the latter. too strong&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="first-machine-learning-project">First machine learning project</h2>
<p>This is the main part of this article. After the elementary learning, I was able to understand the theory to some extent. I was able to explain machine learning to some extent, and finally I decided to start a machine learning project.</p>
<p>However, listening to the story, it seems that what to do with machine learning has not been decided at all, and rather the purpose of introduction is a strong promotion element. In other words, it&rsquo;s OK if you can say &ldquo;This app has artificial intelligence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The app was a search system for certain data, and I also had to create a data search engine (<code>SQL</code>), so I decided to use machine learning for this search engine part. At that time, I was silently listening to what happened.
The specification was decided to be similar to google&rsquo;s search engine, which suggests candidates for the words B, C&hellip; that are often selected along with the word A using past search logs. Also, since the system was used by several people in an on-premise, closed network, it became unnecessary to update the model.</p>
<p>For this case itself, we adopted a simple algorithm as the base, and because the other person had an understanding, we were able to deliver safely without a big flame.</p>
<p>This was my debut as a machine learning project, but I was thinking it was going too far. The genre I worked on this time was called <code>Frequent pattern mining</code>, and there was no talk about the target accuracy. The point was that it was important to watch. You will gradually experience the difficulty of machine learning projects &hellip;</p>
<h2 id="for-maintenance-of-object-detection-cases">For maintenance of object detection cases</h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t talk to you in detail because of the contract, but I have decided to participate in the maintenance of another project for object detection using <code>SSD300</code>. The learning environment and the deployment environment were all built on the <code>ml engine (now AI-platform)</code> of <code>GCP</code>, which was also my first cloud project.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t so much of a problem, and I was informed that the initial delivery date (50% accuracy in the verification data) was cleared without any problems. In the next step, it was supposed that the accuracy of the model would not be improved much and that the final goal would be __90% accuracy. In addition, in parallel, we were refraining from developing apps that used machine learning models, so we were required to make no major mistakes in the direction of accuracy improvement.</p>
<p>However, the setting of this __ precision 90% _ was not good as a matter of course. There was no fixed point about what number was 90% (<code>accuracy</code> or <code>recall</code> or <code>mAP</code>&hellip;etc). Neither the front desk nor the other party understood that the measured accuracy was different from the accuracy of production operation.Normally, this side should strictly define the accuracy and explain it to the other side, and also determine the method of production verification, but the person who can stand the front side and explain the above story on this side Because there is no, there was a situation like this.
As a result, I noticed that the final definition of delivery was messy, and it was not possible to achieve the target of 90% accuracy even further.</p>
<p>In fact, it was a very burning project, and it was a project that I seriously regret.</p>
<h3 id="what-we-learned-from-this-project--start-a-new-learning">What we learned from this project &amp; start a new learning</h3>
<p>Now, of course, if you think about it, when you try to use machine learning as a business, you may overlook it, or even if you know it, you tend to go through it. Export in list format</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine learning is not universal, and it is natural that the accuracy does not improve -&gt; it does not just take time, sometimes it is necessary to reconsider models and specifications</li>
<li>For that purpose, it is necessary to strictly define what measures the performance of the model.</li>
<li>The accuracy obtained from the verification data is not always the same as when released, so do not deliver the model and create a state where it will end without maintenance</li>
<li>The accuracy goal that you have told us cannot always be achieved, so do not concurrently perform simultaneous development (apps and web) with a view to achieving that goal.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t leave the description and definition of delivery to the front desk (sales) only. Engineers need to take the initiative to stand and explain</li>
</ul>
<p>Especially the parallel development of the model and the application is the most common. This is definitely not recommended. It&rsquo;s just a matter of trouble, and if you fail, you can&rsquo;t take responsibility. If you can&rsquo;t answer the question &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t the accuracy reach the target? How can you achieve the accuracy of the target? (Set amount and deadline)&rdquo;, stop it. Good</p>
<p>The knowledge written here may be understood somehow by reading <code>DeepLearning</code> made from scratch, etc., but it is difficult to understand without experience and experience through actual projects. Considering that it is not the end of making and that the created machine learning model operates as an actual service, it tends to be insufficient from the viewpoint of developers only</p>
<p>I became interested in what I needed to do in order not to fail as a machine learning project. I bought <strong>&ldquo;Machine Learning Beginning at Work&rdquo;</strong> here and read it carefully.</p>
<p>Just like the title of the book, I had a lot of know-how on what to think in order to handle machine learning at work.</p>
<h2 id="to-accompany-the-business">To accompany the business</h2>
<p>Exactly one more employee (T-kun) working on machine learning at this time. Originally T-kun was a high-spec person who majored in theoretical physics, so I left it to him to implement and develop machine learning models. Along with that, I followed the sales person</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a major problem with the requirements definition (what is input and what is output)</li>
<li>Avoiding unreasonable demands and precision settings</li>
<li>Answers to technical questions posed on the spot</li>
</ul>
<p>I started talking about it. Then, expand the story that I brought back to T, and check whether there is no problem in implementation, and whether the accuracy setting line is far from the accuracy of the latest paper with similar genre. I made a cycle to By creating this cycle, there are no major mistakes in requirement definition or unreasonable accuracy settings.</p>
<p>Also, as mentioned earlier, parallel development of apps and machine learning models is quite a land mine, so when receiving a challenging machine learning project, always receive it in the form of <code>PoC</code>. .. Be sure to pass the story that it will not be incorporated into the app (this can avoid the risk of spending extra money for the other party)</p>
<h3 id="harmful-consequences-of-this-cycle">Harmful consequences of this cycle</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cycle I made to avoid burning, but it&rsquo;s actually bad. In short, it means that the period will be delayed by the time the project starts. __Before, even if it was a little unreasonable or a strange requirement was defined, I started the project with OK, so if you compare it, the sense of speed will slow down.
In addition, it was often found that the other party did not finalize the specifications while developing the requirements definition. When I said, &ldquo;How do you proceed here?&rdquo;, there were often no responses, and replies would come weeks later.</p>
<p>However, I think that this is unavoidable for avoiding the flame, but inevitably there will be a collision with the sales side.</p>
<h2 id="model-development-project-after-a-long-absence">Model development project after a long absence</h2>
<p>After a while, I was interacting with the sales person and the other party, but since the machine learning development team was running out, I decided to return to model development. This case aims to create a model that searches for similar questions using Doc2Vec.</p>
<p>This case was received in the form of <code>PoC</code>. As an improvement this time, we adopted a form that prepares a report of the transition and progress of the accuracy of the model and delivers it every designated period. Even if this is <code>PoC</code>, it doesn&rsquo;t end with the delivery &ldquo;It was bad&rdquo;, and even if the accuracy does not come out __ Why the result and consideration __ By passing in the form of a report, we aim to ensure that failures do not end in failure</p>
<p>The final result was not good. We considered that the main reason was that the number of data prepared for learning was quite small (about 4,000 unique data) and that the type of data might be too wide. If there was no report, there was a possibility that it would burn like &ldquo;Why is this result?&rdquo;, but since I delivered the report every time, I was able to avoid it and talk about the next case.
This is the latest project I participated in, and now it&rsquo;s a handyman state to participate in web development.</p>
<h2 id="i-decided-to-take-part-in-web-development-and-keep-a-little-distance-from-the-machine-learning-scene">I decided to take part in web development and keep a little distance from the machine learning scene</h2>
<p>The number of web development projects was larger than the number of machine learning projects, and this time there was a shortage of manpower for web development, so I was sent to web development. I won&rsquo;t go into the details of web development, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem like I can go back to the machine learning project for a while.
On the other hand, consultations and requests for machine learning projects are increasing. As a result, I tried to deal with the increased number of projects as soon as possible, and the proposals and plans began to go around without passing through me and T-kun. This is done naturally to avoid the harmful effects created by the cycle I talked about earlier, but there are many parts that I worry about because it is unreasonable in content or the verification method has not been decided.</p>
<p>After all, there is not a little between the front and the other side, I understand what I can do with machine learning and what I can not do (difficulty), and up to the method of accuracy verification (what value is judged good) I feel that I need knowledge to be able to decide</p>
<h2 id="what-i-finally-want-to-convey">What I finally want to convey</h2>
<p>When it comes to studying machine learning, I think it&rsquo;s common to do <code>kaggle</code> or try making a model yourself. Even if you are doing machine learning, there are many cases where the above applies. However, some of the knowledge that is needed in the field is as explained here.</p>
<p>This kind of knowledge is difficult to understand if you do not work in the field, but it is difficult to leave it to the sales person because machine learning-based knowledge is essential.</p>
<p>However, many engineers dislike the work of going to the sales department to explain, so the number of people who can enter more will decrease. I didn&rsquo;t have any background in machine learning, and I couldn&rsquo;t find it interesting to implement the model. However, I was able to find it interesting to think about what to do to solve the problem I received from the other side using machine learning (the best thing is not to use machine learning), and to discuss it.</p>
<p>In the future, I hope that it will be useful as a survival strategy for those who are going through a similar career.</p>
