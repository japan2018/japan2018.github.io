In ①, we have summarized V0 in the above figure, but this article will summarize the use of external APIs such as open data portal.
Issues with V0 In V0, data acquisition relied on (1) scraping from the road website and (2) static CSV files provided by Sapporo City.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  This is a sequel to the previous &amp;ldquo;Visualizing the amount of pollen dispersal and the vegetation of Sugi and the effect of wind from open data (pretreatment)&amp;rdquo;. The previous article is from the link below. https://qiita.com/TakuTaku36/items/40cb590b0ae0c6340f8c This time, we will visualize and analyze winds that may be affecting pollen dispersal amounts, sugi vegetation, and prevalence of pollinosis by prefecture at each observation point in Japan.
#Wind visualization There is a little time left from the previous preprocessing of the data before the compilation of this visualization, and during that time it has been slightly improved so that it can be handled easily by merging the data, so it is not exactly the same, but it is not bad.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  TechTrain&amp;rsquo;s Advent Calendar (https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/techtrain) I&amp;rsquo;m in charge of the 11th day, and I&amp;rsquo;m a first-year college student learning Python for two and a half months. I will summarize what I analyzed lightly.
Content Looking at the hay fever prevalence data in each prefecture, it was found that the hay fever prevalence was high in a wide area in the Kanto region, including Tokyo, where there is no image of sugi growing so much.</description>
