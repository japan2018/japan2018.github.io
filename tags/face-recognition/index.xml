      <description>###Overview  It is full of feeling that face recognition is announced after the end of development of Chainer is announced, I will spell it here as a memorandum.
This series will be sent in two parts. This time, I will explain how to implement the learning phase (learning face images). Next time, I will explain the implementation of prediction phase(facerecognitionusingcamera).
Since I am a ML first-year student and a high school student at the time, some of the information may be incorrect or there may be a bug in the program.</description>
