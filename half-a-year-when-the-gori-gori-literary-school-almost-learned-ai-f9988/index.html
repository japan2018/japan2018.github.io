<pre><code># Half-year when the Gori Gori literary system (deviation value 40 first half) learned AI
</code></pre>
<p>Hi, it&rsquo;s a rugged ~~ macho~~ humanities.
After graduating from commercial high school, I went to the Faculty of Humanities, so it&rsquo;s different from other humanities.
It is a thoroughbred world of humanities.</p>
<p>Although it is a vital math skill, I only studied math A up to high school, and just started math at university.
In other words, the combat strength is about 0.1.</p>
<p>Graduated from Nadataka, entered Harvard, graduated at the top.
I will write poems for what I have been studying and for those who are studying.</p>
<h2 id="what-came">What came</h2>
<p>For those who want to start with implementation, it will be helpful to some extent.
For those who want to start with theory, I think it is better to go to cousera after learning the basics of fine products, linear algebra, and probability statistics. (This is my personal impression.)
You have to be self-taught with motivation, so it&rsquo;s tough, so please customize it yourself.</p>
<h3 id="month-0-i-learned-the-basics-of-programming-through-company-training">Month 0 I learned the basics of programming through company training.</h3>
<p>I studied Java here and became able to build it fairly well.
About two days after the training, I learned the basic grammar of python.</p>
<p>After that, I will study while taking time at the company.
And after the construction of the environment, everything is self-taught.
If you use google colab, it&rsquo;s okay to build an environment, so it&rsquo;s actually a solo (?)</p>
<h3 id="1st-month-keras">1st month, keras</h3>
<p>For the time being, I started with keras&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>&lt;a target=&rdquo;_blank&rdquo; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4839964262/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=1211&amp;creativeASIN=4839964262&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=youyoko0e-22&amp;linkId=ca818f68acfe353931ba37477471 &gt;<img border="0" src="//ws-fe.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=JP&ASIN=4839964262&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=youyoko0e-22" >&lt;/ a&gt;<img src="//ir-jp.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=youyoko0e-22&l=am2&o=9&a=4839964262" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>
<p>This is it.
Is it so easy to implement! That&rsquo;s why the motivation exploded.
Thanks to this book, I was able to understand what I put in and what came out.
I mean, I&rsquo;m not sure, but I can make it. Like this.</p>
<p>After finishing this book (skipping where I don&rsquo;t understand), I did tensorflow official AI tutorial</p>
<p>After that, I was studying a little about why differentiation and integration are important.</p>
<h3 id="second-month-cousera-for-the-time-being">Second month, cousera for the time being</h3>
<p>Then this is this.</p>
<p>Very popular <a href="https://en.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">cousera machine learning</a>.
Free online course.
I ran this in a month.</p>
<p>It was really good.
However, I may have received the one that I knew of the existence of DL4US in the Matsuo laboratory of the University of Tokyo (^ ^;</p>
<p>My impression after receiving cousera is that I was glad that I was able to understand what kind of mathematical formula played what role.
This is where I realized that &ldquo;** You don&rsquo;t have to solve mathematical expressions, as long as you know the meaning **&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="3-to-6-months">3 to 6 months</h3>
<p>From here you can start eating various places.
I was watching qiita or slideshare while I was implementing it.
I also like to study while reading books and watching videos.
I will carefully select the ones that were particularly good.</p>
<h4 id="main-story">Main story</h4>
<p>&lt;a target=&rdquo;_blank&rdquo; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4839962251/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=1211&amp;creativeASIN=4839962251&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=youyoko0e-22&amp;linkId=708acfcbd089556b3b35b35b35a990 &gt;<img border="0" src="//ws-fe.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=JP&ASIN=4839962251&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=youyoko0e-22" >&lt;/ a&gt;<img src="//ir-jp.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=youyoko0e-22&l=am2&o=9&a=4839962251" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s understand neural networks from a simple structure in this book! It is a book like It was easy to concentrate on theoretical understanding.
However, is the English translation a google translation? It&rsquo;s really disappointing that there is something like that.
The content was so good that I studied in an atmosphere.</p>
<h4 id="video">Video</h4>
<p>Mathematics studied with video.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcj-cHmS0uD91MLjtdiN89Q">TRY video lesson</a>.
It&rsquo;s YOUTUBE so it&rsquo;s free and easy to understand.
It&rsquo;s for high school students, so it&rsquo;s a good idea to go home.
I learned only differentiation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqmWJJolqAgjIdLqK3zD1QQ/featured">Series for studying at a preparatory school</a>.
It&rsquo;s YOUTUBE so it&rsquo;s free.
Stochastic statistics, linear algebra learned here.
I like it because the bokeh is not interesting and interesting.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://en.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">cousera&rsquo;s machine learning</a> is also recommended.</p>
<h4 id="site">Site</h4>
<p><a href="https://freelance.levtech.jp/guide/detail/41/">I want to start machine learning! Machine learning algorithm explanation slide summary</a>
Is this statistical machine learning? (Are you sure?) I was able to learn about it so I reread it several times.
Of course, there are many things I do not understand.
Atmosphere game.</p>
<p><a href="https://qiita.com/">Qiita!</a>
Everyone loves qiita. I like it because excellent people can explain it in a way that is easy for them to understand and say things that I don&rsquo;t understand.
I was reading the articles I was interested in while chasing machine learning tags all the time.
I&rsquo;m sorry that I don&rsquo;t have a good article.</p>
<p>[Wikipedia page of mathematical symbols](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%E3%81%25(AE%E8%A1%A8)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%E3%81%(AE%E8%A1%A8)</a>
I used to refer to this when a strange symbol came out.
It&rsquo;s because of the fact that the strange symbols in the paper are explained in the paper?</p>
<p><a href="https://tutorials.chainer.org/en/tutorial.html">Chainer Tutorial</a>
Only mathematics was studied here. You can also use it as a roadmap.
If you feel that you have studied to a certain extent in try and play, you will be able to comprehensively improve yourself if you read this chapter of mathematics.</p>
<h3 id="current">Current</h3>
<p>Build it properly! If you are told, it is a level that can be assembled.
However, I was given a thesis and implemented this! It is impossible if you are told.
You can understand the mathematical formula to some extent while looking at it.</p>
<h3 id="looking-back-on-what-came">Looking back on what came</h3>
<p>It seems as if you have walked the road very straight when summarized in this way, but in reality, without doing so, you can hit the wall many times and make detours, you can crawl around by groping and finally you can improve the road. I feel like I was done.</p>
<p>At first, I couldn&rsquo;t understand the mathematical formula or the code, but I want to know that something amazing works. I think it was big.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-want-to-do">What I want to do</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been following only mathematical formulas so far, so I would like to improve my implementation skills.
Specifically, implementation of self-made layers, self-made loss functions, and self-made optimization functions with keras.</p>
<h2 id="for-those-who-will-study-by-themselves">For those who will study by themselves</h2>
<p>First of all, please understand that self-study is a difficult but one-of-a-kind skill.
Because if you have an internet, you can learn anything.</p>
<p>Below are some of the things I have learned while learning by myself.
~~ There was only one~~</p>
<h3 id="1-understand-what-you-dont-understand">1. Understand what you don&rsquo;t understand.</h3>
<p>The worst thing about self-study is that I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing.
It is not good to get motivated, so let&rsquo;s understand why you do not know why and what you do not understand, and take measures.</p>
<p>One also says. &ldquo;** Clarify why you don&rsquo;t understand **&rdquo; and &ldquo;** Take measures **&rdquo;.
I will say it again. &ldquo;**Why**&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t know, where you don&rsquo;t know, and &ldquo;**Countermeasure**&rdquo;.
I will say it again. &ldquo;**Cause**&rdquo; and &ldquo;**Countermeasure**&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t understand and want to start screaming, please remember &ldquo;<strong>Cause</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>Countermeasure</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There are two steps to finding the cause.
Find out if you don&rsquo;t know &ldquo;where&rdquo; and where you no longer know.
&ldquo;<strong>Why</strong>&rdquo; Write in a sentence why you don&rsquo;t know.
only this.
Along with programming error resolution.</p>
<p>There are various measures.
I feel awkward if I can see when I&rsquo;m sticking, when I use another teaching material, when I go back, and when I skip it.
In fact, if I understand the cause, I feel that I will decide which measure I want to take.</p>
<p>Especially, if you don&rsquo;t know mathematical symbols or mathematical formulas, it&rsquo;s easy to fall down, so if you don&rsquo;t understand it, let&rsquo;s leave it alone for another study.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you overdo it.</p>
<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>
<p>I posted it to qiita for the first time, so I think there are various problems, but it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>If the theme is AI, then math! Math! It tends to look like this, but if you just make a simple one, you don&rsquo;t need that much, so feel free to do it.
Of course, I want to read the paper and implement the latest NN! It is wonderful to study together.</p>
<p>I hope humanities have hope.</p>
<p>Addendum
I am happy that the article has reached many people.
Thank you for watching.</p>
