<pre><code># What are you saying
</code></pre>
<p>Please read this article first (<a href="https://qiita.com/MirrgieRiana/items/da7dade622770a04d8f7)">https://qiita.com/MirrgieRiana/items/da7dade622770a04d8f7)</a>.</p>
<p>In this article, I will implement the &ldquo;algorithm for determining whether the world is inconsistent when given a political party name&rdquo; in Python, which was asked in the original article.</p>
<h1 id="formulate-mathematically">Formulate mathematically</h1>
<p>If NHK is <code>0</code> and the people are <code>1</code>, the “party protecting the people from NHK” can be expressed as the “party protecting 0 to 1”.</p>
<p>If we omit it further and represent it with the list <code>[0, 1]</code>, all parties can be represented by a list of length 2.</p>
<p>For example, &ldquo;the party that protects the NHK from the people&rdquo; protects the party from &ldquo;[[1, 0], 1]&rdquo;,
&ldquo;A party that protects the people from NHK A party that protects the people from NHK A party that protects the people from NHK&rdquo; can be simply expressed as <code>[[[0,1],[1,0]],0]</code>. I will.</p>
<p>And all conceivable political parties (including conflicting ones) can be written this way.</p>
<h1 id="axiom-of-friendship">Axiom of friendship</h1>
<p>In general, when a political party <code>[x, y]</code> exists, it is expected that</p>
<ol>
<li>The political party <code>[x, y]</code> is friendly with <code>y</code> (because the former defends the latter).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Political party <code>[x, y]</code> is not friendly with <code>x</code> (because the former is trying to protect something from the latter).</li>
</ul>
<p>The original article also assumes the following axioms:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are friendly and <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> are friendly, then <code>x</code> and <code>z</code> are also friendly (allies are allies)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, when we say that &ldquo;x and y are friendly&rdquo; as &ldquo;x ~ y&rdquo;,
The above axiom can be paraphrased as &ldquo;relationship <code>~</code> is transitive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In addition, the reflection temperament (I am friendly with myself) and the symmetry temperament (<code>y</code> and <code>x</code> are also friendly if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are friendly) are also considered to be true, so <strong>relationship<code> ~</code> has an equivalence relationship</strong>.</p>
<p>Therefore, it can be seen that all political parties are divided into equal classes without duplication.</p>
<h1 id="is-there-a-third-power">Is there a third power?</h1>
<p>Now, it turns out that all political parties are nicely divided into some camp,
How many camps can exist?
Is there a “third power” that does not give to NHK or the people?</p>
<p>Now, from Axiom 1, <code>[x,y] ~ y</code> holds for any political party <code>[x,y]</code>.
It is clear that the latter has less &ldquo;number of brackets used for notation&rdquo; than the former.</p>
<p>So you can find a friendly party (or NHK or national) with less brackets for any party.</p>
<p>And as we continue to find friendly parties that are less brazen than ourselves,
You can see that eventually the parentheses are <code>0</code>, that is, you will reach the NHK or the people.</p>
<p>Therefore, any political party <code>[x, y]</code> must be friendly with either the NHK or the people,
You can see that there is no third power because it is included in either equivalence class.</p>
<h1 id="conflicting-manifest">Conflicting manifest</h1>
<p>According to Axiom 2, <code>[x, y] !~ x</code> holds for any political party <code>[x, y]</code>,
This means that <code>x</code> belongs to the camp that <code>[x, y]</code> does not belong to, since all parties belong to the NHK or national camps according to the above discussion.</p>
<p>If <code>[x, y]</code> belongs to both camps at this time, it is inconsistent because <code>x</code> does not belong to either camp.</p>
<p>Therefore, there can be no political party on the side of both NHK and the people in a consistent world,
It also follows that if there is any political party <strong>NHK and the people must be hostile</strong>.</p>
<p>To put it the other way around, it means that in a world where NHK and the people are friendly, no political parties are needed.</p>
<h5 id="when-political-parties-conflict">When political parties conflict</h5>
<p>If <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are in the same camp, axiom 1 says that <code>[x, y]</code> belongs to <code>y</code> camp (<code>x</code> camp), and axiom 2 does not belong to <code>x</code> camp. So it will be inconsistent.</p>
<p>To make this equivalent logic easier to handle in a program,
Consider a world in which political parties belonging to both sides are good.</p>
<h1 id="easy-world">Easy world</h1>
<p>Consider the following axiom 2&rsquo;which weakens axiom 2 once.</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">[x, y] belongs to the national camp if x is the NHK camp, and belongs to the NHK camp if x is the national camp
</code></pre><p>When Axiom 2 holds, Axiom 2&rsquo;also holds (under Axiom 1),
The opposite cannot be said.</p>
<p>Under Axiom 2&rsquo;, there is no contradiction even if there are political parties on both sides of NHK and the people.
Because even if a political party belongs to some camp, there is no way to guide that it does not belong to any camp, and no contradiction can occur.</p>
<p>For example, &ldquo;Party to protect NHK from NHK&rdquo; belongs to the NHK camp from Axiom 1
From Axiom 2 it means that it does not belong to the NHK camp, so it is inconsistent,
If this is Axiom 2&rsquo;, it can be said that it belongs to the non-NHK camp and the national camp.
There is no contradiction. It&rsquo;s just a story about everyone.</p>
<p>In this kind world, I think it is clear that the parties that are good for both sides are contradictory parties in the original world.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you investigate the factions in the easy world, you can judge the contradiction in the original world.</p>
<p>#Faction function</p>
<p>A function that assigns a faction to any political party in a friendly world</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">T(x): x \mapsto \{ \{0\}, \{1\}, \{0, 1\} \}
</code></pre><p>Can be defined.</p>
<p>At this time, for any political party <code>[x, y]</code>,</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">T(x) \cap T(y) \neq \varnothing \Rightarrow T([x, y]) = \{0, 1\} \\
T(x) \cap T(y) = \varnothing \Rightarrow T([x, y]) = T(y)
</code></pre><p>You can see that</p>
<p>In other words, whether or not the political party <code>[x, y]</code> is inconsistent in the original world can be determined by recursively examining the factions in the easy world.</p>
<p>#Judge with Python</p>
<p>Keep the contents of the previous section as a program.</p>

<h1 id="addendum-a-how-many-political-parties-are-consistent">Addendum A: How Many Political Parties Are Consistent?</h1>
<p>Now define the political party rank <code>R(x)</code> as follows.</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">R(0) = R(1) = 0, \\
R(x, y) = max(R(x), R(y)) + 1
</code></pre><p>For example, $$R([1, 1]) = max(0, 0) + 1 = 1$$.</p>
<p>Rank 0 is only two, NHK and the people, and both are not contradictory (aside from the actual situation).</p>
<p>There are four rank 1 political parties, <code>[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]</code>, of which two are not inconsistent.</p>
<p>It can be seen that there are <code>6 * 6 = 36</code> pieces because the rank 2 political party is obtained as a combination of 6 groups with rank 1 or lower.
In addition, there are two NHK camps and two national camps in a consistent party of rank 1 or lower, and a political party that is not inconsistent can be created only in combination with the enemy camp.
It can be seen that there are <code>4 * 2 = 8</code> consistent party of rank 2.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is clear that there are <code>(2 + 4 + 36)^2 = 1764</code> parties of rank 3 and only <code>12 * 6 = 72</code> of them are consistent.</p>
<p>This difference opens up more and more as the rank increases, so it can be said that ** almost all political parties in the world are inconsistent**.</p>
<p>Generally, when the number of parties with rank <code>n</code> is <code>p_n</code> and the number of consistent parties is <code>c_n</code>, they are</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">p_0 = 2, \\
p_n = (\Sigma_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k)^2 \\
</code></pre><p>When</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">c_0 = 2, \\
c_n = \frac{1}{2} (\Sigma_{k=1}^{n-1} c_k)^2
