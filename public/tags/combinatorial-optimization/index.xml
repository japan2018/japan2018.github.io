      <description># &amp;lt;i class=&#39;fa fa-graduation-cap&#39; /&amp;gt; Problem  My doctor told me to limit my calorie intake for a week. The minimum required amount of nutrients A and B was also specified. How can I eat what I like as much as possible?
Formulation It is an assignment problem in Combination Optimization Problem. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that food candidates are given, and let 0-1 variable $x$ represent which one to choose.
 Variable$x_i \in \{0, 1\}$$i$ Whether to select the $th dishObjective function$\sum_i{Preferences_i x_i}$$\rightarrow$ Max Constraints$\sum_i{x_i} = 7 $Choose 7 days $\sum_i{calories_ix_i} \le 90 $calorie restriction $\sum_i{Nutrient A_i x_i} \ge 95 $Minimum acquisition amount $\sum_i{Nutrient B_i x_i} \ge 95 $Minimum acquisition amount  Try to solve with python The optimization library is pulp.</description>
