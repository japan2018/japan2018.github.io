<pre><code>#Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>100 knocks of language processing that have been popular for a long time as a collection of problems that you can enjoy learning the basics of natural language processing, its <a href="https://nlp100.github.io/ja/">2020 version</a> was released on 4/6 ! This is the first revision in five years.
<a href="http://www.cl.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/nlp100/">2015 version</a> but those who are interested, those who feel sorry that the 15th edition Qiita article is no longer useful, 15th edition For the person who was doing halfway, but the 20-year edition is coming out and it seems to be heartbreaking, I will summarize what has changed. Of course, it is unofficial, so you may miss some changes.</p>
<h1 id="summary-of-revision">Summary of revision</h1>
<p>As of April 7, according to the official <a href="https://nlp100.github.io/ja/about.html">update history</a>, the following three points seem to have changed significantly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added problem about deep neural network
-Chapters 8, 9 and 10 are all newly created issues</li>
<li>Release of English version (up to number 39)
-It is scheduled to be released sequentially after the 40th number (<a href="https://twitter.com/chokkanorg/status/1247312205671874561">Author Twitter</a>)</li>
<li>Old Chapter 6 (Handling English text) moved to English version
-The corresponding English version has not been published. It seems that it is being created (<a href="https://github.com/nlp100/nlp100.github.io/blob/master/en/ch05.md">Github</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>As I will explain later, as far as I can compare the Japanese version**, the 2015 version has no changes in Chapters 1-5, Chapter 8 has changed tasks, Chapters 9 and 10 have been simplified, and the rest have been deleted* It feels like *. Other than that, the URL of the file to be downloaded has been completely changed (Is it because I am concerned about the character code and the link destination?).</p>
<h1 id="what-changed-specifically">What changed specifically</h1>
<h2 id="old-chapter-1-the-preparatory-movement">Old Chapter 1: The Preparatory Movement</h2>
<ul>
<li>no change</li>
<li>There seems to be no difference in the English version except that &ldquo;Patatoka See&rdquo; became &ldquo;schooled&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="old-chapter-2-unix-command-basics">Old Chapter 2: Unix Command Basics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Title changed to &ldquo;Unix command&rdquo;</li>
<li>tsv file changed. The number of lines has also increased.</li>
<li>No change in question text</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="old-chapter-3-regular-expressions">Old Chapter 3: Regular Expressions</h2>
<ul>
<li>No change in question text</li>
<li>Japanese Wikipedia data updated</li>
<li>English version uses English Wikipedia data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="old-chapter-4-morphological-analysis">Old Chapter 4: Morphological Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Old 33rd &ldquo;Sahen noun&rdquo; was deleted, and new 37th &ldquo;Top 10 words with high frequency of co-occurrence with &ldquo;cat&rdquo;&rdquo; was added</li>
<li>Text file URL updated</li>
<li>English version is &ldquo;POS tagging&rdquo; and comes with a script to download Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland
-Japanese version specifies MeCab, but English version does not specify POS tagger</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="old-chapter-5-dependency-analysis">Old Chapter 5: Dependency Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>No change in question text</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="old-chapter-6-processing-english-text">Old Chapter 6: Processing English Text</h2>
<ul>
<li>Moved to English version as described in the overview</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="old-chapter-7-database">Old Chapter 7: Database</h2>
<ul>
<li>Delete
-I think that it is a reasonable change because there is no NLP feeling only in the old Chapter 7</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="old-chapter-8-machine-learning">Old Chapter 8: Machine Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Move to New Chapter 6
-However, there are many small changes
-Maybe you were aware of the introduction to the method using deep learning in the second half</li>
<li>Task changed from polarity analysis (binary classification) to categorical classification (multiclass classification)
-When I try to open the download location of the new version, I get a warning that the certificate may have expired</li>
<li>The old 78th was performing split intersection verification, but the new version does holdout verification instead
-I think it&rsquo;s a reasonable change as the size of the dataset has increased
-In line with this, in the new version, the data is divided into learning data, verification data, and evaluation data at number 50
-The verification data seems to be used only on No. 58. Is that all right?</li>
<li>Old 71st &ldquo;Stop Word&rdquo; is deleted</li>
<li>Old 72-75, 77 almost moved to new version
-Features → There are small changes such as feature amount
-Following the stop word, stemming was also omitted
-Is it due to the flow of time&hellip;</li>
<li>Old number 76 &ldquo;Labeling&rdquo; removed, new number 55 &ldquo;Create confusion matrix&rdquo; added
-Originally, the significance of existence was a delicate issue</li>
<li>The old 79th &ldquo;precision rate-recall rate graph drawing&rdquo; was deleted, instead the new 58th correct rate-regularization parameter graph is drawn</li>
<li>New 59th &ldquo;Hyperparameter search&rdquo; added</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="old-chapters-9-and-10-vector-space-method">Old Chapters 9 and 10: Vector Space Method</h2>
<ul>
<li>Moved to New Chapter 7 &ldquo;Word Vector&rdquo;
-In the old version, you learned the word vector by yourself, but in the new version you will use the already learned
-Everything else is the same as the previous 10 chapters</li>
<li>Evaluation data was broken, but updated</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-chapter-8-neural-networks">New Chapter 8: Neural Networks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a single-layer (feedforward) neural network using PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.</li>
<li>Matrix construction → prediction → loss and gradient calculation → mini-batch → GPU → multi-layer, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-chapter-9-rnn-cnn">New Chapter 9: RNN, CNN</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implement RNN/CNN (a simple model) that was once often used in natural language processing research</li>
<li>Number 89 is supposed to try transfer learning using a pre-trained language model such as BERT
-The approach currently used in various tasks of natural language processing
-It seems that the library will just work as the sample, but I think that is also an important experience</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-chapter-10-machine-translation">New Chapter 10: Machine Translation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use existing tools to perform neural machine translation
-Machine translation is a core field of natural language processing, and I think that using tools alone will be an important experience.</li>
<li>In 99, create a demo in which the result of machine translation is displayed on the browser
-Old 69th &ldquo;Web application creation&rdquo; was a difficult problem for those who do not know anything, but I think that it became a reasonable form</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="personal-impressions">Personal impressions</h1>
<p>It reflects the latest trend of natural language processing research, and I think it has become more suitable as a collection of problems used for new recruit training for students in the laboratory!</p>
<h1 id="digression">Digression</h1>
