</code></pre>
<p>I would like to briefly introduce the basics of software for people who aspire to the universe so that they can do it at home. Software is intended for students who have done a little in class. (2020.4.9. First edition for the time being).</p>

<h1 id="basic-knowledge">Basic knowledge</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-software-why-is-it-important">What is software? Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Software is simply the language of the computer world, and language can be said to be a tool necessary for &ldquo;transmitting one&rsquo;s thoughts to the other party&rdquo; and &ldquo;understanding the other person&rsquo;s thoughts&rdquo;. In short, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;communication tool.&rdquo; Who connects who? The target is hardware and CPU, the hardware and human, and the target is now important in connecting &ldquo;things&rdquo; and &ldquo;people.&rdquo; How does it relate to space research? Software is indispensable as a tool to “talk” with beautiful images of the universe and the data that you see for the first time in the world.</p>
<p>Software is now recognized as a &ldquo;laboratory device&rdquo; or &ldquo;laboratory technology&rdquo; in space research. For example, in fact, NASA has a team of software experts, and the laboratories that develop experimental equipment have software experts. A software language is a tool to &ldquo;communicate&rdquo; well with a state-of-the-art observation device, and to &ldquo;interact&rdquo; with a huge amount of data. With the recognition that &ldquo;foreign language&rdquo; is as important as English, &ldquo;words&rdquo; It is good to practice the power of grammar and composition while young.</p>
<h2 id="software-language">Software language</h2>
<p>What is the minimum without fear of criticism? Speaking of which, it&rsquo;s python now. However, as there are many languages other than English and French, there are various computer languages, so there are good and bad things, so if you only know a certain language, everything is OK. So let&rsquo;s first take a look at the types of computer languages.</p>
<h3 id="cui-command">CUI command</h3>
<p>CUI stands for Character User Interface (CUI). If it is windows, it can be operated at the command prompt, and if it is Mac or linux, it can be operated at the terminal. If you are new to Hatsumi, please read the following articles first.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techacademy.jp/magazine/5318">I can&rsquo;t hear you now! How to use command prompt [For beginners]</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techacademy.jp/magazine/5155">I can&rsquo;t hear you now! How to use the terminal [for beginners]</a></li>
<li><a href="https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35078006/">16 terminal commands of &ldquo;OS X&rdquo; that Mac users should know</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Why do young people have to type low-level commands? You might have thought In the software world, low-level operations (CUI) are no worse than older ones (GUI). In particular, in analyzing space observation equipment and data, it is important to be able to skillfully manipulate layered software from low to high levels. Automation and maintenance operations must be easy and safe. At its core is a command-line tool, which can waste time if you don&rsquo;t know it early.</p>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s know three of the pattern processing languages. &ldquo;Awk&rdquo; &ldquo;sed&rdquo; &ldquo;grep&rdquo;. &ldquo;Awk&rdquo; can split, select, and calculate character strings. &ldquo;Sed&rdquo; is a character replacement. &ldquo;Grep&rdquo; can search for characters. Since it is a unix command, linux and mac behave as expected by default, but windows does not go straight, so there is no need to force it at the command prompt (it may be easier to put linux base on windows) .. Recently, Windows has Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), so you can easily build linux environment. Please refer to <a href="https://qiita.com/rubytomato@github/items/fdfc0a76e848442f374e">Basic note of WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)</a>. For the three commands,</p>

</ul>
<p>Please read. However, I still don&rsquo;t understand how much I appreciate it.
To give a specific example, let&rsquo;s assume that there is a text file (gal.txt) in which a galaxy catalog of 10,000 objects is written. You can search &ldquo;grep NGC gal.txt&rdquo; to find out how many NGC catalogs there are. If you want to shorten the word &ldquo;NGC&rdquo; to &ldquo;N&rdquo;, you can do it with &ldquo;sed &ldquo;s/NGC/N/g&rdquo; gal.txt&rdquo;. If you want to get only the 10th line onwards, you can do it with &ldquo;awk&rsquo;NR&gt;10{print $0} gal.txt&rsquo;&rdquo;. This is convenient for easily preprocessing data.</p>
<p>Another command is rsync. It is used to sync and copy files. When copying data that increases over time, you may want to avoid copying the data that you have already copied and copy only the changes. rsync is an excellent command tool that calculates such differences, compresses and copies only the differences, and is still often used in the huge data transfer and experiments used in space research. For the first time,</p>

</ul>
<p>Please read around.</p>
<h3 id="low-level-scripting-language">Low-level scripting language</h3>
<p>CUI commands are useful, but you can combine them to do more. For example, suppose there is a case where you want to perform a series of processes such as &ldquo;copying a file once an hour, processing the data in the file, and writing it to another file&rdquo;. Such a series of processing flow is called <a href="https://www.imkk.jp/blog/what-is-batch-processing.html">batch processing</a>. What makes this easy is a &ldquo;shell script&rdquo;. Since there are explanations on the web like a mountain, people who are new to</p>

<p>Please refer to. Recently, I often use python&rsquo;s schedule.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://qiita.com/Kai-Suzuki/items/0c5c0e5cbdb4075fe482">Job execution with Python Schedule library</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to the area.</p>
<h3 id="high-level-scripting-language">High-level scripting language</h3>
<p>By the way, the script language is an interpreter language (translating a program into machine language one line at a time and executing it). &ldquo;High-level&rdquo; means here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/object-oriented">object-oriented</a>.
In space astronomy, I think that python or ruby is the mainstream, but here python is treated as a king.</p>
<p>I will explain how to use python later, so I will only introduce general theory here. Since the interpreter language interprets sequentially, the execution speed is orders of magnitude slower than the compiler language introduced next. However, when performing simple processing such as vector and matrix operations like space astronomical astronomy, a program written in C language or fortran can be read only for that part. Many of python&rsquo;s numerical calculation libraries called numpy use the legacy high-speed module of the past, but python is successful, but it has succeeded in realizing the fast processing. It&rsquo;s a bit technical, but this is due to the technology called <a href="https://esperia.hatenablog.com/entry/2015/11/29/173734">binding</a>, which makes python talk to the C/C++ language. You can do it.</p>
<p>The idea of python is that no matter who writes it, it will be the same. This was a free world where the same processing could be written completely differently in the past such as perl and C language, but on the other hand, it was difficult to read and team development was difficult. Although the rules of python may be strict, the differences between individuals are suppressed to that extent, making the language readable by anyone.</p>
<p>For example, in C language, the code to calculate the difference sin(i+1)-sin(i) of sin(x) is as follows.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c:" data-lang="c:">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#define f(x) sin(x)
int main() {
    double x1,x2,dy;for (int i=0; i&lt;100; i++) {
    x1 = i;
    x2 = i+1;
    dy = f(x2)-f(x1);
    printf(&quot;x, f'(x) = %f %f \n&quot;, x1,dy);
  }
}
</code></pre><p>If you write this in python,</p>
<pre><code class="language-python:" data-lang="python:">#!/usr/bin/env python
import numpy as np
x = np.arange(101)
y = np.sin(x)
dy = y[1:]-y[:-1]
print(&quot;x1, dy =&quot;, x[:-1], dy)
</code></pre><p>You can write without a for loop like this. For python, it&rsquo;s calculated using angle brackets. This is called a &ldquo;slice&rdquo;, and it is a mechanism that allows you to easily access array elements. For details, see <a href="https://qiita.com/tanuk1647/items/276d2be36f5abb8ea52e">[Python] Slice operation summary</a>. Please refer.</p>
<p>In space astronomy, there are many vector and matrix operations, but in python, the operations can be written in an overwhelmingly simpler way than in the C/C++ language. The C/C++ language uses a lot of for loops, but in python, it is easier to operate and access an array without looping, as it is said that &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use a for loop&rdquo; is more like python. Recently, many of the tools for machine learning are based on python. The young people who start from now on will start from python, so there will be no big mistake.</p>
<h3 id="compiler-language">Compiler language</h3>
<p>A compiler language is a type that once compiled is translated into machine language so that the program works optimally, an executable file is generated, and it runs. C/C++ is a compiler language. I still use the C/C++ language wherever speed is needed. For example, FPGA and CPU client and server programs are usually written in C++. High energy people use <a href="https://root.cern.ch">root</a>,solet&rsquo;sstudyC++.Thosewhouse<a href="https://geant4.web.cern.ch">geant4</a>, which is the representative of Monte Carlo simulation, will also need C++.</p>
<h2 id="basic-knowledge-before-handling-software">Basic knowledge before handling software</h2>
<h3 id="environment-variable">Environment variable</h3>
<p>Environment variables are settings that the OS saves and can be set and referenced by the user or executed programs. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;PATH&rdquo; to set the path</li>
<li>&ldquo;HOME&rdquo; representing the path of the current user&rsquo;s home directory</li>
<li>&ldquo;LANG&rdquo; to set the language used by the user (Japanese, English, etc.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;PWD&rdquo; for the current directory</li>
<li>&ldquo;SHELL&rdquo; to specify the default shell path</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. When I enter the laboratory, I often hear the words &ldquo;Did you go through PATH?&rdquo; Its meaning is</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://qiita.com/sta/items/63e1048025d1830d12fd">Try to explain the meaning of &ldquo;pass through PATH&rdquo; as plainly as possible</a></li>
<li><a href="https://itlogs.net/windows-10-path/">Setting procedure and mechanism to pass PATH on Windows 10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://qiita.com/nbkn/items/01a11392921119fa0153">Pass PATH on Mac</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to. It searches for the location of a program in the order in which it is written in PATH.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-cpu-gpu-fpga-embedded-os">What are CPU, GPU, FPGA, embedded OS?</h3>
<p>In studying space astronomy, software and hardware are inseparable. As a basis, let&rsquo;s know the foundation on which software works.</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU: <a href="https://www.pc-master.jp/words/cpu.html">CPU</a>isadevicethatsequentiallyexecutesinstructions.ItworksevenifthereisnoOSaslongasthereisacommandsequence.Thebuilt-inCPUoftenconfirmstheoperationwithoutinstallingtheOS.ThecomputeryouusuallyusehasanOS(windows,mac,linux,etc.). The OS is a block of software that is responsible for interfacing with the hardware. For example, the software called OS is in charge of basic functions such as hitting the keyboard, listening to music, and exchanging files via USB.</li>
<li>GPU: <a href="https://www.kagoya.jp/howto/rentalserver/gpu1/">GPU</a> supports machine learning, which is popular these days. Unlike CPU, it is good at parallel processing routine calculations. Even though the CPU has several cores, the number of cores, such as the GPU&rsquo;s CUDA core, is 10,000, which is an order of magnitude higher, and machine learning has dramatically advanced due to its high degree of parallelism. However, it is not suitable for calculations that cannot be parallelized.</li>
<li>FPGA: <a href="https://www.macnica.co.jp/business/semiconductor/articles/intel/220/">FPGA</a>isanabbreviationofFieldProgrammableGateArray,and&quot;Alargenumberofrewritablelogiccircuitsarearranged.Stuff.&ldquo;Inthepast,weusedanon-rewritablethingcalledASIC,butthedrawbackwasthatitwasexpensiveandnon-rewritable.SinceFPGAsarerewritableandavailableatlowcost,theyhavebecomeanindispensablepartinrecentspaceastronomicalexperimentalequipment.ItiswritteninsoftwarecalledVHDLorVerilog,butrecently,methodsthatcanbedesignedinClanguagehavebecomewidespread.YoucanalsomakeaCPUwithFPGA.CPUcalled<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroBlaze">microblaze</a> is one of the famous.</li>

</ul>
<p>As you can see, the software handled by space astronomy is diverse, including whether the stage it runs on is a CPU, a GPU, or a language that describes an FPGA or software for a CPU with an embedded OS. .. Sometimes hardware and software are designed separately, but recently, a design method called co-design, in which hardware and software functions are designed considering each other&rsquo;s functions, is important. , Young people should know.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-editor">About the editor</h3>
<p>An editor for writing software is like a piece of paper and a pen, and it&rsquo;s pretty important.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://qiita.com/bussorenre/items/bbe757ef87e16c3d31ff">emacs</a> This is an old royal road editor that is diversified in linux and experiments. You should know this as an education.</li>

</ul>
<p>There are many others, but find your own easy-to-use editor.</p>
<p>Setting up and using #python</p>
<h2 id="how-to-install-python">How to install python</h2>
<p>For space astronomical systems, it is recommended to install python with <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">anaconda</a>.Asetofastropy,matplotlib,ipythonetc.willbeincluded.InMarch2020,thepython2seriesstoppedofficially,solet&rsquo;susethepython3series.However,peoplewhomayusetheoldpython2seriesarerecommendedtoinsertanacondapythonin<a href="https://qiita.com/mogom625/items/b1b673f530a05ec6b423">pyenv</a>.<a href="https://qiita.com/mogom625/items/b1b673f530a05ec6b423">pyenv</a> can switch the python version for each directory, so it is recommended for people who have mixed modules of different versions.</p>
<h2 id="plotting-with-matplotlib">Plotting with matplotlib</h2>
<p>In the last few years, the python version of MATLAB has been used explosively and I recommend <a href="https://matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a>. The installation will be automatically entered if you insert anaconda.</p>
<p>For example, fft can be easily done with python. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://qiita.com/yamadasuzaku/items/946eb042c7302e836c63">Confirming Percival&rsquo;s theorem using Fourier transform (FFT) of matplotlib and scipy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to. Since the FFT part is executed by the binary of Fortran, the speed is not much different from that of C++.</p>
<p>Many people, such as experiments, observations, and cosmology, now write diagrams in matplotlib, so it&rsquo;s a good idea to learn them.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>It is kind to the first person that there are many Japanese commentary articles.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-search-while-looking-at-beautiful-pictures-of-the-universe">How to search while looking at beautiful pictures of the universe</h2>
<p>One of the attractions of the universe is a beautiful picture. It would be interesting to see what kind of observation data there are in the past while looking at it. At the moment,</p>
<ul>

<p>Searching for celestial bodies and searching for data seems to be easy, and each observation has its own individuality, so it is necessary to look carefully. There are others, but let&rsquo;s master the useful tools.</p>
<h2 id="catalog-research-of-space-using-python">Catalog research of space using python</h2>

<p>There are two ways to run hesoft, one is to download the source code and compile, and the other is to use binary. Try it in binary first, it should work just through the path, if it doesn&rsquo;t, try compiling from source code.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Passing the path&rdquo; means the following description in a configuration file such as .bashrc
Is to write. For example, I have two machine environments, so
Here are two examples.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash:" data-lang="bash:">export HEADAS=/usr/local/astroh/software/HEASOFT/Hitomi_Release_03_rc1/x86_64-debian-linux-gnu-libc2.19-18+
source $HEADAS/headas-init.sh
## For suzaku analysis
export CALDB=/usr/local/xray/caldb
export CALDBCONFIG=$CALDB/software/tools/caldb.config
export CALDBALIAS=$CALDB/software/tools/alias_config.fits
</code></pre><p>In short, set $HEADAS and where headas-init.sh is.</p>
<p>Satellite-related tools require CALDB satellite setup data, so
Download CALDB and set the path.</p>

<p>When you start researching the universe, I think that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS">FITS</a>(readasFitz) will come out many times, which is a standard in the astronomical industry. A file format.</p>
<p>The basic information of the header part is an uncompressed text file, and the data consists of a compressed binary file. For binary files, please refer to <a href="https://c.keicode.com/lang/text-vs-binary.php">What are text files and binary files</a>.</p>

<p>It is necessary to take a large amount of logs when performing space astronomical analysis. The number of file names is the same, and information such as arguments and messages when the program is run. This is important experimental data and should be recorded. It will also benefit you. There is always a time when I will be doing something for myself in the future, such as what I did, the program was running, but I was actually throwing an error. It is not the amount of information that can be recorded by hand, so log it electronically. Recently, there are various tools such as evernote and bear, so you can choose your favorite. (Note: It doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t need a paper lab notebook.)</p>

<p>Get into the habit of &ldquo;searching in English&rdquo; once you enter the world of research. It&rsquo;s fine if you can get enough information in Japan, but if you are a little more specialized, the amount of information in the English-speaking country is overwhelmingly large, so let&rsquo;s make a habit of searching in English.</p>

<h2 id="literature-search-method">Literature search method</h2>
<p><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu">ads</a> is the royal road. There should be almost no papers on the universe that can be found here. If you search for a single paper, you can subtract the papers that refer to the paper or cite the paper to increase the number of papers in the potato formula. In this era, there are so many papers that you will not be able to read them even if you spend your whole life.</p>
<p>Another famous one is <a href="https://arxiv.org">arxiv</a>. The fastest gathering of papers from all over the world is here. However, please note that some papers will be published before they are accepted, so some papers that were rejected later will be included. After that, even the accepted paper is not 100% correct. Science requires lots of trials and verifications, and good journal articles often find mistakes later.</p>
<p>In the age of flood of information, it is easy to get the right information, but it is difficult to find the information you really want and the truth. Conversely speaking, people who have the ability to quickly collect the truly necessary information and determine the truth are also the human resources needed by society as well as research. Studying astrophysics and astronomy is also the best stage to enjoy such powers.</p>

<p>In general, the writing style and style are different depending on the field, so write the style according to the journal that submits the paper. I think that the most important thing in a dissertation is that one new thing is enough, and that it is the core to convey it. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be surprising to people all over the world to say &ldquo;new&rdquo;. Any small step that no one has yet achieved is a valuable scientific activity. Going into the dissertation will make your goals clear and clear, so make it a habit to always study with the dissertation in mind.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-copy-the-display">How to copy the display</h2>
<p>If you want to have the same screen on your PC and the projector,
Turn on the mirroring. Turn off mirroring if you want to change it.
<a href="http://tokyo.secret.jp/macs/macbook-mirroring-option.htmlThere">http://tokyo.secret.jp/macs/macbook-mirroring-option.htmlThere</a> are two types of computer screens that can be transferred to the display: analog and digital. Recently, HDMI cables (digital) are the mainstream. Please note that the HDMI cable can transmit both video and audio, so if your computer&rsquo;s audio output is HDMI, there may be no sound from the microphone.</p>

<ul>
<li>Press the track pad deeply to release the click</li>
</ul>
<p>Mechanical wear occurs when clicking with a deep press on the trackpad. For mac users, click System Preferences ==&gt; Trackpad ==&gt; Tap to check Click with one finger. Now you can click with a soft touch. (If you care more, you can use an external keyboard, mouse, or trackpad, but isn&rsquo;t it a laptop?)</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not leave the power on for a long time.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the viewpoint of the life of the power supply, there are various opinions about whether to frequently turn the power supply on/off or reduce it. However, if it is obviously slow, there are many cases where dead apps are wasting energy just because they have not released memory, so I personally turn off the power about once a week. Please keep it.</p>
<h2 id="about-installation-tools-for-mac-users">About installation tools (for mac users)</h2>
<p>There are three types of mac, fink, macport, and homebrew, but if you are going to set up a PC from now on, I definitely recommend using <a href="http://brew.sh/index_ja.html">homebrew</a>. I will. The other two are due to lack of support now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with <a href="http://brew.sh/index_ja.html">homebrew</a>, but be careful, use only one. If they are mixed, when one of them is moved, the setting file may be rewritten, which is often addictive.</p>
<h2 id="password-search-method-for-mac-users">Password search method (for mac users)</h2>
<p>There is a tool called keychain that manages passwords as a function of the OS, even if the mac user doesn&rsquo;t have to remember the password or manage the text file with the password.
Hit the keychain with the spotlight (magnifying glass on the top right).

<h2 id="how-to-use-zsh-bonus">How to use zsh (bonus)</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick introduction to what&rsquo;s good about zsh. Since it is newer than bash and tcsh, there are many good things. For those who say &ldquo;what is a shell?&rdquo;, please read <a href="https://wa3.i-3-i.info/word11219.html">shell</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant file search</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you can&rsquo;t remember where you saved it but look for a file with the extension cc,</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash:" data-lang="bash:">&gt; ls **/*cc,
</code></pre><p>It will look for *cc files under the current directory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Command-based history search is possible, and options can be immediately remembered.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you can&rsquo;t remember what options you had after rsync,</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash:" data-lang="bash:">&gt; rsync
</code></pre><p>If you type up to ctl + p, it will tell you the history of rsync + ○○.</p>
<p>In addition, please refer to <a href="http://blog.blueblack.net/item_204">http://blog.blueblack.net/item_204</a> etc.</p>
<p>If you want to make the initial settings easily, in the .zshrc,</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh:" data-lang="zsh:">HISTFILE=$HOME/.zsh-history # used for storing commands
HISTSIZE=100000
