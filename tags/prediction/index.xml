      <description># at first  I am not an infectious disease specialist, so please read it after understanding.
The new corona pneumonia (Covid-19) that occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China from December 2019 has spread to Japan and the number of infected people is increasing. I am interested in how the number of infected people in Japan will increase in the future. Therefore, I searched for articles on infection prediction models. Infection models have already been announced from all over the world, but parameters such as the infection rate and the isolation rate greatly affect the accuracy when predicting with an infection model.</description>
