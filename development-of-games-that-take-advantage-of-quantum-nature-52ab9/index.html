<pre><code>Hello Sugo of Quemix.
</code></pre>
<p>Here is an overview of the projects currently underway at IPA&rsquo;s unexplored business.
By making a game that includes the properties of quantum, we are going to make two games within the period. This time, we will introduce the first game.</p>
<p>#Notes
If you try to explain everything such as the history of the game, the details of the rules, the explanation of quantum, etc. so that it can be understood by those who are new to the game, the amount will be too large, so it is a rather broken introduction Please note. I would like you to feel only the atmosphere of what you are doing.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m not doing anything technically good, so I haven&rsquo;t included the code. I&rsquo;m not using any programs for quantum computing such as qiskit this time either (because I&rsquo;m not doing anything as complicated as I am using them).</p>
<h1 id="content-of-this-article">Content of this article</h1>
<ul>
<li>Project Outline</li>
<li>On the nature of quantum as the subject</li>
<li>Outline of game rules</li>
<li>Awareness</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="project-outline">Project Outline</h1>
<h2 id="develop-a-new-game-that-connects-the-nature-of-quantum-to-the-fun">Develop a new game that connects the nature of quantum to the fun</h2>
<p>We aim to be able to play as many times as possible. Just using overlays won&rsquo;t be interesting. Even if you don&rsquo;t know about Quantum, you can understand the rules of the game, and through play, you will gain a sense of Quantum, etc.</p>
<h2 id="the-strategy-taken">The strategy taken</h2>
<p>Considering a completely new game from scratch is quite a hurdle, so I decided to attach a quantum element to an existing game and create a new game. I also thought that knowledge of the original game would be useful in understanding the rules in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="achievements-so-far-epr-pair-discovery-game">Achievements so far (EPR pair discovery game)</h2>
<p>I made an EPR pair discovery game. The project is still in the middle, but as mentioned above, we are going to make two games, and all the games introduced this time are over. I implemented it in pygame and it&rsquo;s ready for me to play. The theme of this game is &ldquo;Nervous breakdown + entanglement&rdquo; **. It is a game to find pairs with quantum properties called EPR pairs in the way of nervous breakdown. The final rule is often separated from nervous breakdown, but the idea starts here.

<h1 id="about-the-quantum-property">About the quantum property</h1>
<p>In the EPR pair discovery game, a card gimmick called a Q card that contains quantum properties will appear. The quantum element of this work appears only in this Q card, so if you understand here, the rest is a normal game.</p>
<h2 id="q-card">Q card</h2>
<p>Normal playing cards have numbers and marks (suits) written on the front, and if you turn the playing cards facing back, you can see both. The numbers and marks on the playing cards do not change over time, but the Q card has the following differences.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 2 types of numbers, 0 and 1, and 2 types of marks, + and-</li>
<li>Q card has both numbers and marks on the table, but you can see only one number and mark at a time</li>
<li>Numbers and marks may randomly change results each time you look</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are the following 5 types of Q cards.</p>
<ul>
<li>0 card: The number is always 0, but the mark is + and-with a 50% probability</li>
<li>1 card: The number is always 1, but the mark is + and-with a 50% probability</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Card: The mark always shows +, but the numbers are 0 and 1 with a half probability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>-Card:-is always shown as a mark, but the numbers 0 and 1 appear with a half probability</li>
<li>EPR Card: Both numbers and marks have a 50/50 chance. Two pieces are always one set, and the numbers and marks will always match.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Suddenly words such as Z measurement and X measurement come out, but please forgive me because it is a diversion of the slide)</p>
<p>Although detailed explanation is omitted, the quantum property (quantum correlation) adopted this time is the property that the results match whether you look at this number or the mark.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-actually-make-a-q-card">Can I actually make a Q card?</h2>
<p>As a complete digression, this Q card like a quantum playing card can not be made from ordinary paper, but the argument that a programmable electronic paper can make a real thing to touch Was the interim briefing session the other day. Let&rsquo;s make it with someone.</p>
<p>#Outline of game rules
From here, I will briefly explain the rules of the game (some details are omitted). The game does not convey the rules in sentences and the fun is not conveyed, so it is best to show the demo in some way originally, but this time only the rules are introduced.</p>
<h2 id="field-condition">Field condition</h2>
<p>Place 4-8 Q cards in the field. There are 1 to 4 EPR pairs (2 to 8 cards). For cards other than EPR pairs, 4 types of cards that are not EPR cards among the 5 types of cards mentioned above are randomly placed. For example, if there are 8 Q cards and 2 EPR pairs, the remaining 4 cards will be random Q cards (excluding EPR cards). The player does not know what type of Q card is placed. If all Q cards in the field are EPR pair cards, no cards are randomly placed.

<h2 id="actions-that-players-can-take">Actions that players can take</h2>
<p>This game consists of the following three actions. There is no distinction between &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; and &ldquo;answering&rdquo; in normal nervous breakdown, but the role is clearly divided in this work.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to see
-Check either the number or the mark on the selected Q card
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/309762/33e64283-476e-c830-406b-c5db85532e9b.png" alt="Picture2.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To answer
-You can declare that the selected Q card is an EPR pair, and if you answer correctly, you can get that pair.

</li>
<li>
<p>Additional answers
-Later</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="victory-conditions">Victory conditions</h2>
<p>The player with the <strong>last</strong> EPR pair in play wins.</p>
<h2 id="game-flow">Game flow</h2>
<ul>
<li>Determine number of players (2-4), number of Q cards (4-8), number of EPR pairs (1-4)</li>
<li>Each player performs the following actions one by one (until winning or losing is decided)
-Select two Q cards from the field and see the number or mark
-You can see up to 2 times per turn (You cannot change the 2 cards you see in the 1st and 2nd times)
-Choose whether or not to answer the two cards selected above
-If you do not answer, move to the next player at the end of turn
-Answer, and if the answer is correct, that player can add an additional answer
-Answer, if the answer is incorrect, the next turn player can add an additional answer</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="additional-answer">Additional answer</h2>
<p>If someone answers, you are entitled to additional answers depending on the outcome. This additional answer is the only mechanism in this game that creates an information gap between players. The basic rules are the same as the normal answer, except for the following points.</p>
<ul>
<li>The results of additional answers can only be seen by <strong>players with additional answers</strong>.
-Play results other than additional answers are shared equally by all players. It&rsquo;s the same as the original nervous breakdown. Of course, if you answer correctly with the additional answer, the number of cards in the field will be reduced, so the result will be shared with everyone, but if it fails, only the player who answered the additional answer will know the result.</li>
<li>Even if the additional answer is incorrect, it will not be answered by the next player. That is, no risk.</li>
<li>If you answer correctly with additional answers, you can make additional answers.

</ul>
<h2 id="about-additional-response-specifications">About additional response specifications</h2>
<p>The specification of this additional answer is a bit delicate in that it can honestly get a pair. There was a person who personally advised me on this point at an interim briefing session the other day, so it may be better to consider changing to a rule that utilizes quantum more than that, but within the unexplored period Probably not possible.</p>
<h2 id="the-game-you-are-aiming-for">The game you are aiming for</h2>
<ul>
<li>The original game nature of the memory game that remembers the result of looking at the card
-In this game, you will remember whether or not the same number or mark was generated, not the number or mark itself.</li>
<li>Game game of bargaining by choosing whether to answer
-Answer and get additional information only for you if you succeed
-Respond and, if unsuccessful, will give the opponent additional information</li>
</ul>
<p>#Awareness
Here are some things I thought about while making a game and what I noticed.</p>
<h2 id="about-probability">About probability</h2>
<p>This is the first problem that comes into play, but when quantum is added, the probability factor comes in. The probability game (= luck game) basically tends to be a fucking game, so if you add quantum elements without thinking about anything, there is a high probability that it will become a fucking game even if the original game is interesting. There are a lot of interesting games even if there is a factor of probability, but in my opinion, the decision of the player needs to be reflected in the winning or losing of the game. You have to design the area well.</p>
<p>In addition, games that do not originally have a probability factor (complete information games such as Othello) do not seem to be very compatible with each other. In these games, there is no element of luck, so it is interesting to predict the behavior of the opponent and read ahead, but if the element of probability is included, it will be impossible to read ahead.</p>
<h2 id="complicated-rules">Complicated rules</h2>
<p>(Here, I wrote that it is based on the knowledge of quantum theory.)
When putting the element of quantum into the game, if you seriously do &ldquo;make and measure entangled quantum state&rdquo;,-Make a stack</p>
<ul>
<li>Entangle</li>
<li>taking measurement</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see that it takes 3 steps like. I think that the rules become too complicated if you add the actions of the players corresponding to these. In other words, it is surprisingly difficult to change from the classical state to the quantum state by the player&rsquo;s hand. Although it is only a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; operation of turning the card originally due to nervous breakdown, there is a high possibility that the simplicity will be impaired if you try to add these actions. I thought that this can be said for all games where the behavior of players such as Othello is simple in the first place. Of course, even if the rules are complicated, there is no problem if they are designed to be easy to understand.</p>
<p>The solution I took to this problem this time was that the entangled quantum state was realized from the beginning, and the player only measured. After the measurement, the system will automatically return to the entangled initial state, so the action of the player can be kept simple.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility-with-nervous-breakdown">Compatibility with nervous breakdown</h2>
<p>In the conventional nerve breakdown, the information on the card once seen is definite information (♠️ is not ♣️ next time), whereas this EPR pair is an EPR pair no matter how many times it is measured. Cannot be &ldquo;determined&rdquo; to be (maybe just coincidental results). Also, it is possible to specify the type of Q card by remembering the numbers and marks that came out, but do not remember 4 pieces of information (whether 0, 1, +,-is issued) per Q card I can&rsquo;t do that, so the limit will come soon. As you can see, if you try to learn it seriously, you will suddenly learn more. So I&rsquo;m doing it myself, but <strong>it may have a low affinity with memory games</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, this is not limited to memory games, but rules that require some kind of judgment and memory for each state of the field that has expanded due to stacking are not realistic at all. I think this is probably the case even if the game has a full log. It is essential to devise to reduce the amount of information that players have to be aware of.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-think">How to think</h2>
<p>In the process of making this time, I changed the idea of making quantum gimmick (Q card in this case) from the idea of adding quantum to the rules of existing games. The advantage of this is that you can limit the quantum nature within that gimmick (the quantum coverage is clear). In addition, by not including random elements as much as possible in parts other than the quantum gimmick, it is possible to achieve a balance so that the player&rsquo;s decision can fully influence the outcome of the game. In other words, I thought it would be better to consider the fun as a quantum and the fun as a game separately. In this case,</p>
<ul>
<li>Fun as a quantum
-Q card gimmick</li>
<li>Fun of nervous breakdown
-A sense of accomplishment that I remembered the information that I gave out
-Exhilarating feeling when consecutive pairs are taken</li>
</ul>
<p>The quantum gimmick was added while keeping the fun of nervous breakdown, and it was established as a rule, and the element of bargaining that was not in the original was added.</p>
<h1 id="finally">Finally</h1>
<h2 id="is-that-interesting">Is that interesting?</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s ridiculously funny, but if you think nervous breakdown is interesting, I think you can play as it is. I&rsquo;ve been playing it many times, but I think it can withstand the goal of repeated play.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-second-game">What is the second game?</h2>
<p>In production. There is a gimmick idea.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-play-this-from-now-on">How to play this? From now on?</h2>
<p>Currently, I have no choice but to come to me (or go to me). Excuse me. However, I received some inspiration from the mid-term briefing session, which I haven&rsquo;t done yet the other day, and I received some voices that I would like to play, so I hope to play it somehow.
The appearance and UI are still difficult to play (I wonder if someone can make it with a decent UI (small voice)), but I would appreciate it if you could give us your thoughts on the published Akatsuki. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us (<a href="mailto:ssugo@quemix.com">ssugo@quemix.com</a>).</p>
