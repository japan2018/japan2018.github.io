      <description>## What is Streamlit?  Streamlit is an open source framework for Python.
Goal this time For the time being, I would like to easily make something like a web application. The most difficult part in creating a web application is the processing of the back end and the creation of HTML files, but Streamlit seems to have no need to do those tasks at all. You can make a web page with just one Python file.</description>
