      <description>In a certain discussion flow, I decided to read [PEP-593 (Flexible function and variable annotations)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0593/), so I wrote down my understanding. Leave it in.  Overview  PEP-3107 (Function Annotations) introduced annotations into the Python syntax. At that time, the type hints, DB query mapping, and RPS marshalling information were mentioned as the uses of annotations. PEP-484 (Type Hints) introduced a method to implement type hints using annotation notation. It can be said that this is the main usage of annotations.</description>
