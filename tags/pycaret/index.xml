      <description>#Introduction  The other day, I tried using the machine learning library PyCaret that was released. Data feature analysis and performance comparison work with multiple models will be automated, and the work time of data scientists up to now will be considerably reduced.
This time, I will apply PyCaret to the Titanic survival prediction problem, submit the prediction result to Kaggle, and see the result.
**This is a follow-up article to I tried to classify wine quality with PyCaret, which I posted last time.</description>

#1. Install PyCaret
Run the following code to install. I use Anaconda, but I launched and installed a virtual environment dedicated to PyCaret. An error may occur in a virtual environment managed by an existing Conda.</description>

      <description>What is #PyCaret  I recently saw an article called Announcing PyCaret 1.0.0 .. It was an interesting library, so in this article I will explain how to use PyCaret. **PyCaret is a Python library that enables data pre-processing, visualization, and model development with a few lines of code in machine learning model development. **
PyCaret is a Python wrapper for some of the major machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.</description>

      <description># Overview   PyCaret, a library for machine learning with low-code, has finally become v1.0. Visualization of machine learning model is convenient, so let&amp;rsquo;s focus on Visualization of model and summarize.  If you check Source,youcanseeYellowbrick@HP(Yellowbrick@qiita). *In addition, it is taken up by Qiita in PyCaret tags below.  I tried using PyCaret at the fastest speed Introduction to the library &amp;ldquo;PyCaret&amp;rdquo; that automates machine learning    things to do The enumeration is as follows, but it can be executed in a few lines by automation of pycaret.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Immediately, I tried using the machine learning library PyCaret released the other day. I realized that anyone can easily model. It was really easy! You can tune and predict from preprocessing without writing 10 lines of code! Although there are many parts that I have not understood yet such as arguments, I decided to write the article of PyCaret first. If you have any notes, please comment.
