<pre><code>#Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>Oshido!
So, as a Hui graduate engineer, I will write down the past and present as a memo.</p>
<p>For those who do not know optical communication, see the article a year ago.
<strong><a href="https://qiita.com/LightSign/items/1f869369ff23969b53ce">Last article link</a></strong></p>
<p>And I will write articles in the language of people who are often used in optical communication.
*The words are exaggerated, so not all the wording in the article is correct.
*Please write &ldquo;Tame&rdquo;, but please forgive me</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;.know.
I know.
No one should know the wording of optical communication.</p>
<p>Optical communication salesman does not see qiita
↓↓
Engineers and programmers do not agree with the language of optical communication
↓↓
Optical communication wording doesn&rsquo;t make sense
↓↓
But I&rsquo;ll do it</p>
<p>So I will use it as a wording for optical communication.</p>
<h1 id="graduate">Graduate</h1>
<p>It is also qiita, and I often hear this word, but I always
&ldquo;Ooi, conclusion Yanke
Articles from lower educational backgrounds can be helpful. Daily? <strong>Your phone sales</strong>? I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, I want to give courage to those who are undergraduates in the lower classes.
*By the way, I am not a college graduate but not a graduate</p>
<h1 id="target-of-this-article--out-----quoting">Target of this article ※, out ~ 〇 ~ ~ quoting</h1>
<p>1, a salesman&rsquo;s habit, a dislike of going out and meeting people</p>
<p>2, a salesman who is not good at excuse that &ldquo;I am poor and I can only do business&rdquo;</p>
<p>3, Immediately after studying as an excuse because I have low educational background</p>
<p>4, &ldquo;The programming did it! FizzBuzz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>5, &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll study when I&rsquo;m done! ~After returning home~ No, I&rsquo;ll look at the ceiling on the sofa and think about it.&rdquo;
Sleep instantly for loop guy</p>
<p>6, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t programming mathematics? Can&rsquo;t do mathematics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>7, &ldquo;I change my life with TECH::CAMP EXPERT! There is money!&rdquo;
The reason why I visited Shibuya because I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied</p>
<p>8, &ldquo;I understood the for if sentence, but what is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>9, I didn&rsquo;t want to say &ldquo;I was able to scrape! What is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>10, &ldquo;I got a web app! God! What is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>11, udemy&rsquo;s [180,000 people in the world] practice Python data science
&ldquo;Are you? You can&rsquo;t change jobs at all in Data Science Raku Yanke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>12, &ldquo;Uooo!!! sklearn!! I was able to judge Ayame!!
AI! Artificial intelligence! Wai is also an AI data scientist with an annual income of 50 million.</p>
<p>This is all me w</p>
<h1 id="what-i-can-do-now-as-a-web-development--data-analyst--it-can-not-be-done-perfectly">What I can do now as a web development &amp; data analyst * It can not be done perfectly</h1>
<p>■Web development axis
・You can write a web application (Django) in GCE from scratch and deploy it in an hour.</p>
<p>・You can create databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL).</p>
<p>・You can run nginx(web server).</p>
<p>・You can run gunicorn(app server).</p>
<p>・Member registration and login functions can be incorporated into the web application.</p>
<p>・Built-in payment API (Conclusion, please praise someone.)</p>
<p>・You can add a function to change the service provided by free users, paid users, and pay-as-you-go.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added asynchronous processing function in celery (It is a time difference processing.)</li>
</ul>
<p>・The appointment has been completed with Django&rsquo;s Class Based Views.</p>
<p>・Recently, I also wrote test code.</p>
<p>・GoogleAppEngine is also an easy victory.</p>
<p>・I&rsquo;m going to make an API-like thing with Google Cloud Functions.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use CloudFunctions with GoogleCloudScheduler to make it look like cron.</li>
</ul>
<p>・Csv,jpg,pdf will be saved in GCS (Google Cloud Storage).</p>
<ul>
<li>It will be saved from pandas DataFrame to Bigquery.</li>
</ul>
<p>・I will touch HTML&amp;CSS for a moment.</p>
<p>・SPA is done with vue.js! There is nothing I cannot conclude.
Low educational background &ldquo;Is it javascript, isn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s not python, is it possible?&rdquo;
I don&rsquo;t have any hopes, I&rsquo;ll make it.
So I conclude that Tame is a zero appointment.　Loop play around 23:00 after you got home.</p>
<p>■ Data analysis axis
・Basic operations of pandas can be done as fast as pressing the telephone number at the time of tele-apo.
(I know only those who have tele-appointed, but this is quite fast w)</p>
<p>・Because you can manipulate data with group by, pivot, merge and concat of DataFrame.
The customers were surprised too. Because it is an immediate contract.</p>
<p>・Visualization of data using seaborn.</p>
<p>・Training and accuracy verification using various machine learning models of sklearn.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because the character vectorization is the strongest in word2vec. Conclusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>・Big query can be used, and what is visualization in Data Portal?
Low educational background &ldquo;Is it necessary to learn SQL in addition to python?&rdquo;
What? Is it licking? Do you sell only your copy machine?
No, wouldn&rsquo;t you sell online lines, credit cards, and other fucking products together?
Because knowledge other than the copy machine is necessary. That&rsquo;s why Temee was told to be a True True brain.
<strong>while True Tele-Apo</strong></p>
<h1 id="i-can-get-such-a-project-when-i-try-to-change-jobs-to-a-normal-company-now">I can get such a project when I try to change jobs to a normal company now</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting a business so I don&rsquo;t feel like changing jobs,
Suddenly, the salesman&rsquo;s heart revives, &ldquo;How much can I sell?&rdquo;
I tried to change jobs around February before Corona w</p>
<p>As a result, the following offer was obtained.
I&rsquo;m not a regular employee because it&rsquo;s a hassle, so I only apply for dispatch.</p>
<p>[Unofficial proposal]</p>
<ul>
<li>python+vue.js web application development project Hourly wage 3,200 yen Annual income conversion 5.4 ~ 6 million (including overtime)</li>
<li>python+SQL data analysis project Hourly wage 3,000 yen, annual income conversion 5 to 5.7 million (assuming overtime work included)</li>
</ul>
<p>[Y status]
Age: 34 years
Programming history: 3 years (SQL 1 year, python data analysis 1 year, python web application 1 year)
Education: Hui graduate
Career: Moving company → About 7 job changes → Entrepreneurship
My uncle&rsquo;s unlucky job hopper shit history, but he said that he could change jobs due to an easy victory.</p>
<p>And the most important thing to convey
&ldquo;Oh, low-education guys rotting there!</p>
<p>The match isn&rsquo;t over yet.
It&rsquo;s a long time to die before you can fight.
I thought that the game was decided up to the university, but it was a rotten prejudice of low education.</p>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t think you can sell a heavy copy machine at first?
But why don&rsquo;t you brainwash your brain and make a reason to sell it?
Low educational background &ldquo;N? Lease? Not sell?&rdquo; → &ldquo;Sold!!&rdquo;
You can do it if you do.
You can&rsquo;t sell because you think you can&rsquo;t.
Customers want it. It&rsquo;s your fault that you can&rsquo;t make me want it.
That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a zero appointment. seriously. Later on</p>

In the 70th year, let&rsquo;s knock down the octopus of the University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, Sophia Waseda and other highly educated people!</p>

Change the game yourself.
It’s okay, put in optical communication. It&rsquo;s a lie but w</p>
<p>What about Wai?
In conclusion, I&rsquo;m winning. The optical communication salesman will do it until he wins.
That&rsquo;s why pandas merge and concat are the opposite.
You&rsquo;ll reverse the brain of Tame?</p>

</code></pre></div><p>After all, I had an interview with a person from the University of Tokyo on zoom,
Wai is the interviewer, and on the other side the interviewee?
It depends on how you think, but once you win.
I heard that your low educational background was overthrown by the University of Tokyo.
This is the angry power that was played from the beginning.</p>
<p>So the game has just begun,
Kimi, who has low educational background, is free, so let&rsquo;s fight for life.
I&rsquo;m sorry for fucking fucking you</p>
<p>If the Warrior of Light is watching this, put an appointment on Wye w
I&rsquo;ll do my best in the training in the mountains w</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m about to change game software. I want to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, what should I conclude?
Think about it!I will tell you because my superior said to me.</p>
<h3 id="1-start-studying-udemy-youtube-programming-school-whatever">1. Start studying udemy, youtube, programming school, whatever.</h3>
<p>Low educational background &ldquo;No, overtime.&rdquo;
I&rsquo;ll overthrow it.
I&rsquo;ll quit anyway, so I&rsquo;ll have to come home on time.
Besides, it&rsquo;s a crap record?
Instead of killing at the company, go home and kill at home.</p>
<h3 id="2-create-deliverables-with-web-apps-smartphone-apps-or-data-portal">2. Create deliverables with web apps, smartphone apps or Data Portal.</h3>
<p>Low educational background &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of anything to make&hellip;&rdquo;
I&rsquo;ll use a handwritten pencil to write the python code on the notebook.
Even if it&rsquo;s handwritten, the indentation is wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the original one.
I don&rsquo;t mean the guy you told me to think about.
Because you have a low educational background.</p>
<h3 id="3-apply--email-to-job-changing-sites-that-can-be-registered-and-all-companies-that-can-receive-them">3. Apply &amp; email to job-changing sites that can be registered and all companies that can receive them.</h3>
<p>While my senses are paralyzed by the treapo. Promise with old man.
Low educational background &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t accept Google anyway&rdquo;?
Stupid.
I wonder if I could go to the meeting with the wrong name or something wrong?
Stay there until you die.
Maybe you can get Google with a monthly salary of 100,000.
The time limit is not fixed. I don&rsquo;t like low education because of this.</p>
<h3 id="4-if-you-get-a-job-in-programming-put-everything-into-work-and-study">4. If you get a job in programming, put everything into work and study.</h3>
<p>Low educational background &ldquo;I got used to it in 3 months, I will win easily, today&rsquo;s flower money&rdquo;
What?　If you do this, you will kill it.
Thank God who made pandas. Worship Google made by Bigquery.
I won&rsquo;t pull it to Django&rsquo;s github.
Before and after work, Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays All the time from morning till night.
He has a low education because he cuts out on the way.</p>
<h3 id="5-make-a-service-that-is-useful-for-work-in-non-work-hours">5. Make a service that is useful for work in non-work hours.</h3>
<p>Low educational background &ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t work well on salaries, isn&rsquo;t it useless?&rdquo;
That&rsquo;s why Teme reads &ldquo;what and what&rdquo;.
&ldquo;Let me take a note&rdquo; says &ldquo;Please take a note **&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Show value at the company.
It&rsquo;s a small fish, so don&rsquo;t be discouraged from doing work and not doing work.
If you improve something with your own creations, it&rsquo;ll be fun!</p>
<h3 id="6-every-3-months-figure-out-how-much-you-can-sell">6. Every 3 months, figure out how much you can sell.</h3>
<p>Low educational background &ldquo;Eh? Isn&rsquo;t it a job hopper? There is a lawyer who hired me.&rdquo;
I&rsquo;ll fly away. That&rsquo;s why I was told that there was no if branch in my brain.
I&rsquo;ll use it instead of a washing machine-I&rsquo;ll leave a copy machine and do not lease for 10 years!</p>
<p>Even if you say programming in the first place, there are web apps, smartphone apps, data analysis, and more.
Who decides that the first company with a tie is right for it?
Low educational background &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never done data analysis, but the web app suits me better than data analysis!&rdquo;
What? I had curry and ramen, and I ate only curry,
Why do you prefer curry to ramen?
Curry should be put in the ink of the copier that is leased!</p>
<p>In other words, what kind of job suits you and what kind of skill you need
You have to measure where you are.</p>
<p>After all
Low educational background &ldquo;After all, data analysis is good I didn&rsquo;t fit the web app&rdquo;, right?</p>
<p>Low educational background &ldquo;I understand that. But there is a lawyer-in-law&hellip;&rdquo;
Well, I can&rsquo;t deny my in-law personality,
Tame&rsquo;s loyalty will increase his salary,
The company doesn&rsquo;t take responsibility for Chimi&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Keep looking for the best place.
Anyway, the probability of finding the best place in one shot with a low educational background is 0.00001%.
However, the best place will change in the first place.
Also, what about the side that gets fucked?
Now it&rsquo;s time to do a good game. Try various games.</p>
<h1 id="current-situation">Current situation</h1>
<p>Now that the company&rsquo;s sales have been stable, I&rsquo;m leaving the web application operation and other tasks to another person.</p>
<p>Even if I don&rsquo;t work, my company is ruined, so in the second half, I devote myself to studying math and English.
Every week, I have a one-on-one lesson in math &amp; English by letting Kim Power speak.
In December of this year, I am studying with the goal of shooting youtube programming videos in brown and English with atcoder.</p>
<h1 id="study-other-than-programming">Study other than programming</h1>
<p>Everyone with low education should study English if programming.
A TOEIC score of about 500 is good. seriously.
If you search for an error by programming, <strong>Stack Overflow</strong> and each document will be relied on from the middle.
Low educational background &ldquo;Can you translate with Chrome?&rdquo;
That&rsquo;s why Temee has a low educational background and I don&rsquo;t know the taste. Take a cup of coffee and say, &ldquo;Mecca scent!&rdquo;
Make 100 yen coffee ok.
Instead of tapioca, I don&rsquo;t drink the button of the telephone that I use for tele-apo!</p>
<p>Well, believe it anyway.
Highly educated guys try to trick you right away, but I&rsquo;m low educated so it&rsquo;s okay.
With you and others, I&rsquo;m allowed to join a fucking game from the beginning of my life.</p>
<p>The senior who cleared the fucking game said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to wear this.&rdquo;</p>

This is for those with low educational background who don&rsquo;t understand grammar.
Those who don&rsquo;t understand English will study from now on.</p>

Read this regardless of programming.
Unfortunately the author has died,
This is what taught me how to escape the fucking game.
In conclusion, this is the god of God.</p>

<p>#Finally
It&rsquo;s boring you are making your life.
You also make an interesting life.
The seven custom professors Cobby mentioned above said, and indeed they did.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that highly educated bastards tend not to sleep even now.
In other words, even if Teme made an effort, he would have made more efforts in a highly educated person.
I don&rsquo;t think you have low education,
McKinsey and the Goldman Sachs gods do their best without sleeping.
Even though you are originally a god, you are going to work even more endlessly? Isn&rsquo;t it too strong?</p>
<p>High education is not a concept of effort, but a strong desire for knowledge since childhood,
Even on Saturdays and Sundays, I didn&rsquo;t think of studying, I naturally learned something like breathing.
Of course, there are many people who are trying hard to get the necessary work done.</p>
<p>But the way isn&rsquo;t dirty. Look at this
Highly-educated &ldquo;Eh? I haven&rsquo;t studied, but I do it as a hobby.&rdquo;
Yes, it came out. Deadly ** Unconscious study **.
It&rsquo;s like a miracle sword + mysterious armor that recovers every turn.
FF is like auto regenerator.
It&rsquo;s a Mighty Guard (FF5) environment since I was born.</p>
<p>In short, low education requires more effort than high education to die.</p>
<p>Low educational background &ldquo;It was not an environment where I could study when I was a child.&rdquo;
Know. I can&rsquo;t help being unfair.
That&rsquo;s the reality.
So do whatever with your anger power.
Even if I complain, the fucking game does not change, so change by action.</p>
<p>Highly educated will stop learning, and continue to train with anger power until that time.
I&rsquo;ll win.</p>
