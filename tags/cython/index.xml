      <description>Cython is coming to #AtCoder!!  Language updateIwasabletotryCythoninthenewjudgetestenvironmentbybeingacrew,soItriedit.Bytheway,whatisthefirsttimetotouchCython?Idonotknow(laugh)
By the way, Python 3 after the language update is 3.8.0, Cython is 0.29.14.
Python code works as is ABC085C-I tried it on Otoshidama.I submitted the source code that was ACed at 678 ms with Python 3 and submitted it as Cython as it was and ACed at 614 ms.
from sys import exit N, Y = map(int, input().split()) for i in range(N + 1): for j in range(N + 1-i): k = N-i-j if 10000 * i + 5000 * j + 1000 * k == Y: print(&amp;#39;%d%d%d&amp;#39; %(i, j, k)) exit() print(&amp;#39;-1 -1 -1&amp;#39;) Syntax error is CE instead of RE!</description>

      <description># Python program is slow! I want to speed up! At that time...  When implemented in Python, the processing time may be too long to meet the requirements. In that case, there are four types of measures shown in this article.
If you do something to speed it up, you lose something else. Typical examples of trade-offs are freedom of expression, readability, dependency, memory usage, and CPU usage. Please follow the usage and capacity and use correctly.</description>
