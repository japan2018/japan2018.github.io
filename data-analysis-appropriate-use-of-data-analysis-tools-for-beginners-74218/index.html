<pre><code># Purpose of this article and target audience
</code></pre>
<p>There are many tools for data analysis.
Here, data analysis tools include Excel, programming, dashboard tools, BI tools, etc.</p>
<p>In this article, for those who are new to data analysis and those who are going to do data analysis, we will explain what kind of analysis tool should be used for what kind of situation.</p>
<p>The most important reason to decide what kind of analysis tool to use in what situation is that the right tool can make data analysis efficient.
Where programming isn&rsquo;t necessary, you may not need to force it,
In some situations, a handy BI tool is useless and may require some programming or SQL knowledge.</p>
<p>Also, the person who is going to analyze the data will run into the question of how much knowledge they should have for the analysis they want (or are entrusted to).
At that time, if you have some idea of what kind of analysis tool to use for what situation, you can predict how much knowledge you will need.</p>
<h1 id="analysis-tools-targeted-by-this-article-and-their-features">Analysis tools targeted by this article and their features</h1>
<h2 id="data-analysis-classification">Data analysis classification</h2>
<p>There are two main types of data analysis: &ldquo;<strong>ad hoc analysis</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;regular analysis&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For companies and research that do not have a well-established data analysis platform and are not automated, they will manually analyze the data each time it is needed.
This is called an ad hoc analysis in the sense of an ad hoc analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Ad hoc analysis</strong> uses interactive analysis tools that allow you to execute queries and data transformation/aggregation processing and immediately check the results.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a dashboard tool that automatically aggregates and displays data to some extent is used when regular reporting is required rather than manual analysis each time.</p>
<p>here,
・Excel
・Programming language
・BI tools
・Dashboard tools</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at each of the features and specific products, and see what tools are used in what situations.</p>
<h2 id="excel">Excel</h2>
<p>First of all, everyone knows Excel teacher!
I grew up being trained to analyze data programmatically without using Excel, so I&rsquo;m actually weaker at Excel than at Python&hellip;</p>
<p>In fact, Excel is sufficient for simple analysis.</p>
<h3 id="pipot-table">Pipot table</h3>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s learn how to use the Pivot table.
This is the basis of any data analysis that is a crosstab with a pivot table.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cross-m.co.jp/column/marketing/util58/">Cross tabulation is the basis of analysis! </a></li>
<li><a href="https://allabout.co.jp/gm/gc/297727/">How to use the pivot table! Crosstab easily with Excel</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sbbit.jp/article/cont1/35476">How to use Excel Pivot Table in an easy-to-understand way and how to simplify cross-tabulation</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/115709/9632c956-5528-668f-3b73-df5585471c0e.jpeg" alt="l_bit201809181254004717.jpg"></p>
<p>The idea of cross tabulation is the same whether it&rsquo;s Excel or programming, so I can&rsquo;t talk if this idea isn&rsquo;t familiar.</p>
<h3 id="what-excel-is-not-good-at">What Excel is not good at</h3>
<p>Excel is a very useful tool, but there are limits to data integration.
Although increasing the number of columns in the horizontal direction is an Excel-like process, it may be difficult to integrate data in the vertical direction.</p>
<p>For example, consider the case of handling time series data from a sensor.
(When abstracted, Google Analytics is also like a sensor, right? lol)</p>
<p>Suppose sensor (1) records data every 1 second and sensor (2) records data every 10 seconds.
When collecting and integrating these data, the data of the sensor ① should be averaged every 10 seconds, and the representative value should be fetched and merged.</p>
<p>It is a hassle to do these processing in Excel, and if the number of data reaches hundreds of thousands or millions, Excel will slow down the calculation.</p>
<p>Although,
For example, Excel may be sufficient when dealing with management indicators.
At best, we only discuss the results by counting the weekly and monthly results.
Therefore, consulting companies and accounting firms still recognize that Excel can be used as an important skill.</p>
<h2 id="programming-language-python">Programming language (Python)</h2>
<p>Here, Python is taken as the programming language.
It&rsquo;s no exaggeration to say that it has dominated the world as a programming language for data analysis in recent years, and Python has a wealth of libraries for data analysis, and the Jupyter Notebook interactive tool described later is popular.</p>
<h3 id="jupyter-notebook">Jupyter Notebook</h3>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/115709/a1882411-45c5-4d11-836f-c3f659f83159.png" alt="labpreview.png">
(From <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Official Home Page</a>)</p>
<p>Jupyter Notebook is an open source interactive script execution tool.
In addition to Python, programming languages such as Ruby and R can be executed.</p>
<p>You can visualize the results of each processing step.
Since you can also write explanations in Markdown format, it works well as a report for others to see.</p>
<p>The most popular way to create graphs in Python is <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>.
It&rsquo;s possible to create a stylish graph like the one you took from the official website above.</p>
<p>The following books are useful for data analysis and visualization using Python.</p>
<ul>
<li>[IPython Data Science Cookbook Second Edition](<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/IPython%E3%83%87%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%82%B5%25">https://www.amazon.co.jp/IPython%E3%83%87%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%82%B5%</a> E3%82%A4%E3%82%A8%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%83%96%E3% 83%83%E3%82%AF-%E7%AC%AC2%E7%89%88-%E2%80%95%E5%AF%BE%E8%A9%B1%E5%9E%8B%E3% 82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%94%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%82% B0%E3%81%A8%E5%8F%AF%E8%A6%96%E5%8C%96%E3%81%AE%E3%81%9F%E3%82%81%E3%81%AE% E3%83%AC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%94%E9%9B%86-Cyrille-Rossant/dp/4873118549/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_2/355-1889098-6063963?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=4873118549&amp;pd_rd_r=ff22b633 69a4-4cb3-b7ef-4b43770ccce2&amp;pd_rd_w=721iz&amp;pd_rd_wg=5k45z&amp;pf_rd_p=ca22fd73-0f1e-4b39-9917-c84a20b3f3a8&amp;pf_rd_r=6E4TX40027T4BEWS7G3B&amp;G6B4&amp;4c4&amp;4=4</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="python-limits">Python limits</h3>
<p>Of course, mastering Python for data analysis is not easy.
From the beginning of programming, learning costs are high.</p>
<p>So, in the sense that non-engineers can&rsquo;t analyze data, it&rsquo;s not really democratized.</p>
<h2 id="bi-tool">BI tool</h2>
<p>Therefore, BI tools have become popular as data analysis tools in recent years.
Many people have heard of the name of the tool Tableau.</p>
<p>I hear that in recent years, more and more consulting companies are using Tableau for analysis.</p>
<p>When I was working for a consulting company, I had a feeling that Tableau was now younger, younger and trendier than Excel.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/115709/d11b9b9b-ab15-2488-8538-1d80d0f22288.png" alt="server_dashboard_overview_3x3.png"></p>
<p>(From <a href="https://www.tableau.com/ja-jp/products/server">Tableau Official Homepage</a>)</p>
<p>It is suitable for team members to conduct analysis while making graphs.
In terms of usage, the dashboard tools described below are aimed at automating analysis, while BI tools are used for more exploratory data analysis.</p>
<h3 id="what-bi-tools-cannot-do">What BI tools cannot do</h3>
<p>BI tools are great and very valuable as they promote democratization of data.</p>
<p>However, even if BI tools can handle integrated data, they are not good at (they can do) the integration itself.
You must write your own SQL queries for data aggregation and integration before using BI tools.</p>
<p>So, in the end, for a meaningful analysis, you need a data preprocessing team that integrates the data and makes it easy for BI tools to read.</p>
<h2 id="dashboard-tool">Dashboard Tool</h2>
<p>In contrast to ad hoc analysis, dashboard tools are used for the purposes of regularly querying and creating reports and charts.</p>
<p>Some of the more famous are Redash.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/115709/08d06b22-9894-2c5f-00fe-faf47e515b0a.jpeg" alt="https___qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com_0_112537_63ce8ef8-422d-bd17-5e35-f6e6e8520726.jpeg"></p>
<p><a href="https://qiita.com/suzukihi724/items/91950450734e4c9913cf">Setting up docker-based redash on AWS EC2 from scratch</a></p>
<p>Dashboard tools focus on automating the analysis of data and allowing it to be reviewed on a regular basis.</p>
<p>However, many dashboard tools, such as BI tools, do not support creating interactive dashboards.
It is optimized to visualize the latest information on a regular basis.</p>
<h3 id="limits-of-dashboard-toolsin-order-to-use-the-dashboard-you-need-to-run-a-programming-language-or-sql">Limits of dashboard toolsIn order to use the dashboard, you need to run a programming language or SQL.</h3>
<p>(Of course, pretreatment is also required separately.)</p>
<p>In fact, a visualization tool that claims to be capable of advanced things is, in fact, &ldquo;you can write and execute Python code internally&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="https://tech.mercari.com/entry/2017/05/19/150728">Merchari&rsquo;s data science team and story of analytics ecosystem</a>
According to this article</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Mercari, there are many people who can write SQL even for non-analyst jobs and do simple analysis by themselves.
Recently, there are rumors that the finance department, accounting department, legal department, and designers are also studying. (It is a fact)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That.
Everyone needs to do their best to study because they need to execute SQL for analysis.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an ordinary company, you&rsquo;ll have the problem of who wrote the SQL.</p>
<p>For companies that have a fixed business improvement flow and constant indicators to follow, it is a good idea to spend some money to prepare a data analysis base and introduce a dashboard tool.</p>
<p>However, usually, the indicators and data that you want to see change rapidly, so you have to change SQL as well.</p>
<p>#Summary
For companies that have a solid data analysis platform and can afford to properly aggregate and integrate data, it is advisable to introduce BI tools and visualization tools.
If members other than engineers want to analyze data and utilize it in their daily discussions, they have no choice but to introduce BI tools and visualization tools.</p>
<p>However, if the KPI you want to see has not been set, or if you are not sure what to consider, it is a good idea to use BI tools to discuss it with everyone.</p>
<p>For companies that have already standardized the flow of consideration from data analysis, it would be better to use a visualization tool to automate the analysis.</p>
<p>If the data analysis infrastructure is not yet in place and you are just accumulating data for the time being, do ad hoc analysis using a programming language
By doing a proper ad hoc analysis here, it becomes clear what KPIs are important to the company and what you want to consider using the data.
This is a very important step.</p>
<p>Even if you suddenly automate an analysis, it may end up being obsolete.
Since it takes time and money to set up the data analysis base, it is absolutely not good to start creating the analysis base without thinking deeply.</p>
