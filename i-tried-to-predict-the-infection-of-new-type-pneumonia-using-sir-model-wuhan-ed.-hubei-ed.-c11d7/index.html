</p>
<pre><code>Recently, new pneumonia has become popular.
</code></pre>
<p>Since I had previously conducted a study using a mathematical model of infectious disease called SIR model, I applied it to a new model of pneumonia. Mathematical models can be used to predict the future of infectious diseases.</p>
<p>This time, we focus on <del>Wuhan</del>*** Hubei Province*** (provinces including Wuhan), which is the center of the outbreak, to model infectious diseases and predict the future of infectious diseases.</p>
<h2 id="keyword">keyword</h2>
<p>Epidemiology, SIR model, nCoV-2019, new pneumonia, new coronavirus</p>
<h2 id="sir-model">SIR model</h2>
<p>The SIR model is a model that expresses the transition of the number of infected people as a differential equation (it is also easily analyzed by <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIRmodel">Wikipedia</a>). In the SIR model, a person is considered to have three states for infectious diseases.</p>
<ol>
<li>Possibility of infection: S</li>
<li>Infected person: I</li>
<li>Those who have acquired immunity by dying from infection or those who have died: R</li>
</ol>
<p>The SIR model is expressed as S(t), I(t) and R(t), respectively, for those who are likely to be infected at time t, who are infected, and those who have been cured from the infection.</p>
<p>$$
\dot{S}(t) = -\beta S(t)I(t),\<br>
\dot{I}(t) = \beta S(t)I(t)-\gamma I(t)\<br>
\dot{R}(t) = \gamma I(t)
$$</p>
<p>It is described as.
Where β is the infection rate and γ is the recovery rate (+ mortality rate).
The number of infected people is proportional to the infection rate β, the number of people S(t) who may be infected, and the number of people I(t) who are infected.</p>
<p>Note that deceased people do not cause infection, so equate them with those who have been cured.</p>
<p>here,
$$
S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N
$$
Is constant and corresponds to the population of the area.
This time, we will use the population of <del>Wuhan</del> in Hubei Province.</p>
<p><del>Wuhan</del> Using the infection data of new hepatitis in Hubei province, we will learn the infection rate β and the recovery rate γ to predict the future of Wuhan.</p>
<h2 id="data-used">Data used</h2>
<p>The infection data is taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/data">here</a> which is published on kaggle.
In addition, the population data of <del>Wuhan</del> Hubei Province is based on the 2017 demographic data described in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_administrative_divisions_by_population">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="parameter-learning-using-sir-model">Parameter learning using SIR model</h2>
<p><del>Wuhan</del> The transition of infection in Hubei Province from January 22 to February 4, 2020 is as follows.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/245708/efd47fa2-78d5-4cc8-ccfa-8ae4a4337289.png" alt="Hubei_time_dose.png"></p>
<p>The blue line is the number of infected people, the orange line is the number of deaths, and the green line is the number of people who have recovered.
Is it a bit strange that the number of people recovered and the number of deaths are roughly the same? I think.</p>
<p>I tried fitting with the SIR model so that this data could be expressed.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/245708/dfb14a13-5eca-909b-e236-2b8f8c7c807d.png" alt="SIR_model_Hubei.png"></p>
<p>Recovered people is the sum of recovered people and deaths.
In addition, the blue points are the number of actually infected persons and the blue lines are the results approximated by the SIR model.
The orange points and orange lines are the actual and predicted values of the number of people who recovered.</p>
<p>It seems that it can be approximated sufficiently.</p>
<h2 id="-wuhan--predict-the-future-of-infection-in-hubei">~~ Wuhan ~~ Predict the future of infection in Hubei</h2>
<p>Since it seems that it can be approximated sufficiently, I tried to predict the future of infection in <del>Wuhan</del> Hubei using the learned parameters.</p>
<p>The following figure is the forecast from February 4th to 10th.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/245708/1fba04a6-417d-9adf-dd82-bf4ba2216721.png" alt="Hubei_10days_future.png"></p>
<p>The points are the measured values and the lines are the predicted values.
According to the SIR model, it seems to increase still more.</p>
<p>The following is a forecast for one year from February 4th.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/245708/81cdaead-2725-3ae8-2f43-9994acbe9b00.png" alt="Hubei_365days_future.png"></p>
<p>The infection seems to stop at all.</p>
<h2 id="consideration">Consideration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using the SIR model, <del>Wuhan</del> I predicted the spread of new type pneumonia infection in Hubei Province, but the prediction result is that the spread does not stop.</li>
<li>~~ Wuhan ~~ It seems that the number of recovered people in Hubei Province is not accurately measured.</li>
<li>If it is possible to accurately measure the recovery rate γ using other data, it may be possible to make a better prediction.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future-tasks">Future tasks</h2>
<p>Next, I would like to predict the spread of infection throughout China based on traffic volume.</p>
<h2 id="update-basic-reproduction-number-r0">Update: Basic reproduction number R0</h2>
<p>The infectivity of the disease is evaluated by the basic reproduction number R0.
R0 is given by the ratio of the dimensionless infection rate β_hat and the dimensionless recovery rate γ_hat. Therefore, the basic reproduction number R0 in Hubei Province is</p>
<p>$$
R_0 = \frac{\hat{\beta}}{\hat{\gamma}} = \frac{\beta N^2}{\gamma N} \approx 17.54
$$</p>
<p>It becomes.
This value is about the same as airborne diseases such as measles, which is probably because the recovery rate is underestimated, as mentioned in the discussion.</p>
