      <description>This is the [Open and Reproducible Science Advent Calendar 2019](https://adventar.org/calendars/4523): Day 13 article.  Article purpose S is the name for statistical analysis. But there are people like me who want to do anything with just Python. For such people, I will introduce useful libraries and techniques for doing statistical analysis in Python. There are many articles and books on the same subject, but I will focus on those that are not often introduced elsewhere.</description>
