      <guid>https://memotut.com/i-tried-web-scraping-to-analyze-the-lyrics.-0aee4/</guid>
      <description># Purpose  I wanted to analyze the lyrics, but it was difficult to collect the lyrics, so I tried scraping for the first time. To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m a little worried because I haven&amp;rsquo;t written HTML properly, but I wanted to do it because I could do what I wanted to do. I would appreciate it if you could give me any advice or notation.
This is the article I referred to this time.</description>

      <title>I want to sell a product that was exhibited by Mercari python scraping</title>

      <description>## Trigger  Do you sell anything you no longer need using Mercari? I also sell unnecessary books in Mercari, but since they are old reference books and study books, they are hard to sell. .. ..
Mercari will offer a &amp;ldquo;sellable price&amp;rdquo; when listing. However, if I set it to a high price, I can&amp;rsquo;t sell it, and if it&amp;rsquo;s too cheap, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve lost something.
Before setting the price of an exhibit, I conduct a search to find out what the real market price is.</description>

How to eliminate garbled characters If you use requests, you would normally write it like this,
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import requests res = requests.get(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(res.content,&amp;#39;html.parser&amp;#39;) If you do this, some sites will be garbled, so the following can eliminate the garbledness considerably.</description>

      <description># **Introduction**  I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, but I will omit the explanation of horse racing terms. I think it is read by people who are interested in horse racing.
Information published on netkeiba.com (information taken by scraping) There are various types such as pedigree, running time, and mileage. As a premise, the scraped data is used as a model When I fit it, I don&amp;rsquo;t expect anything. It is necessary to select, organize and analyze information.</description>

      <title>Scraping with Tor in Python</title>

      <guid>https://memotut.com/scraping-with-tor-in-python-81f4b/</guid>
      <description>## Note  :warning: This article does not recommend scraping with Tor.
Scraping is basically okay, but if you are prohibited by the terms of use of the target site or if you put an excessive load on the server of the target site, you may be punished.
What is Tor It is a technology that anonymizes the connection route. Theoretically, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to determine who accessed using Tor.
Execution environment Homebrew 2.</description>

      <guid>https://memotut.com/disguise-ip-using-tor-on-macos-and-check-with-python-6adb5/</guid>
      <description>I was writing because I was thinking of scraping with python,  If the same IP address is accessed for a certain period of time, the access will be denied for a while. When a site like this appears, it may not be possible to scrape well, so I will try to impersonate the IP address and scrape.
However, since the operation is confirmed only for macOS, I think that the method is a little different especially for windows.</description>

First of all, note that scraping is basically the last method you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do if you don&amp;rsquo;t need it. This time, scraping Qiita&amp;rsquo;s tag ranking, Qiita has an api and gets tag ranking there. There was no api to do (as of December 8, 2019) so I scraped it. If you can get the information you want with api, get it with api.</description>

      <description>#Trigger  It&amp;rsquo;s only one year left until Arashi&amp;rsquo;s activities stop. It&amp;rsquo;s been 20 years since the appearance of invisibility costumes. What did the national idol, who is active in multiplayer, want to tell the fans 20 years after the formation? I would like to meet you in person, but that&amp;rsquo;s why. So I decided to &amp;ldquo;visualize the lyrics&amp;rdquo; and convey the message I want to convey to the fans, ~~ the 6th member~~ to Arashi fans.</description>

      <description>My name is mogken and I am in the business planning office of an IT venture company.  Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about changing jobs, and I&amp;rsquo;m studying programming to make it appeal to me. It&amp;rsquo;s not so appealing to say that you&amp;rsquo;re just studying with your mouth, so I made a simple web app with Python and Django, built it on AWS, and released the source to Github.
This time, I would like to explain the program (Python) I wrote myself, which also serves as an output for the fixation of knowledge within me.</description>
