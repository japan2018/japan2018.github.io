<pre><code># Purpose of this article and target audience
</code></pre>
<p>This article provides a guide to those who have barely studied statistics before being able to speak brilliantly about Young&rsquo;s statistics in the now known Bayesian stats.</p>
<p>The goal of this article is to be able to tell <strong>correct</strong> things about Bayesian statistics with a doya face, and to be able to argue with people who are familiar with statistics.</p>
<p>Please note that studying this article will not make you familiar with Bayesian statistics.
To be able to use it in the field, you need to be able to program to some extent, and the actual data that is the target is also required.
Before we can really do statistical processing, we also need preprocessing&hellip;</p>
<p>Data analysis using statistics requires not only the theory of statistics but also various tools to be worn.
(Remembering the sleepless nights&hellip;)</p>
<p>Basically, I will introduce learning methods using books.
If you know statistics to some extent, you can skip the book in the middle!</p>
<p>#What is Bayesian statistics</p>
<h2 id="bayesian-statistics-overview">Bayesian statistics overview</h2>
<p>What is Bayesian statistics in this article? I will not go into detail about that.
If you know somehow that statistics have frequencyism and Bayesianism (in other words, more precisely), and if you know that they are fundamentally different positions, then you can read this article. I will.</p>
<p>For more information, please refer to the article below!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://qiita.com/katsu1110/items/2535e8d1b5be457fcfcf">I want to be a Bayesian! Bayesian statistics starting from almost zero 1 (probability and Bayes theorem)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ill-identified.hatenablog.com/entry/2017/03/17/025625">But now, what is Bayesian statistics?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For the time being, the authors are also vaguely writing and there are some quirks.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m saying these articles badly, though.
The goal of this article, which I&rsquo;m writing now, is to be able to understand when I read these articles what I am blurry about, or what I am writing without really knowing.</p>
<p>The only important thing to say about Bayesian statistics is
Bayesian statistics are neither absolutely better, nor upward compatible with non-Bayesian statistics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a thought.
It is a religion.</p>
<p>Absolutely correct statistics is just an illusion.
There is no dream story in this beautiful but ruthless world that Bayes can solve all other statistical problems.</p>
<p>What is the principle/position in which you take? It&rsquo;s just a deep question.</p>
<h2 id="position-of-bayesian-statistics-in-statistics">Position of Bayesian statistics in statistics</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, Bayesian statistics is just a principle/position, as mentioned above.
However, there is a &ldquo;principle&rdquo; that becomes fashionable and obsolete at each era.</p>
<p>Democracy is the most obvious example.
People in the modern developed world think of democracy as the best political method, but it&rsquo;s not always good.
Shouldn&rsquo;t there be times when principles other than democracy worked as they were? is.
Perhaps after 1000 years, democracy may be stupid.</p>
<p>In the world of statistics, frequencyism has been criticized in recent years.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Amateur&rsquo;s opinion of statisticians on ASA&rsquo;s statement that announced the six principles of p-values, worried about misunderstanding and abuse of statistics and &ldquo;p-value supremeism&rdquo;](<a href="https://y-mattu.hatenablog.com/entry/(2016/03/09/034248)">https://y-mattu.hatenablog.com/entry/(2016/03/09/034248)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mikuhatsune.hatenadiary.com/entry/20160308/1457437678">Amateur () statement to a data scientist&rsquo;s blog statement to the American Statistical Society&rsquo;s statement, &ldquo;Do not be overly concerned with p-values and significance, let&rsquo;s end the era in which p &lt;0.05 determines everything&rdquo;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://takenaka-akio.org/etc/stat_test/">Meaninglessness of statistical significance test</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you read this article, you&rsquo;ve probably heard phrases that say &ldquo;significant difference.&rdquo;
The mainstream of statistics in the 20th century was frequencyism.
It means that &ldquo;p-value&rdquo; and &ldquo;significance&rdquo; of &ldquo;statistical hypothesis test&rdquo;, which is the most convenient tool of this mainstream frequency-based statistics, are under criticism.</p>
<p>So, Bayesian statistics are gradually spreading as a frequency-based antithesis.</p>
<p>Also, handling Bayesian statistics requires a huge amount of computing power, and in the last 10 or 20 years, everyone has finally been able to handle Bayes.</p>
<p>Two years ago when I was in graduate school, an increasing number of researchers were arguing that I should not rely too much on p-values, such as agricultural science (biological statistics), which I specialized in, medical statistics, psychological statistics, etc. I felt like I was there.</p>
<p>I think it would be better if I could talk about Bayes if I wanted to create a cool (laughs) future.</p>
<h1 id="an-introduction-to-bayes-for-beginners-in-statistics">An introduction to Bayes for beginners in statistics</h1>
<h2 id="introduction-to-frequency-principle">Introduction to frequency principle</h2>
<p>In order to understand Bayesism properly, let&rsquo;s study frequencyism first.</p>
<p>Bayesianism and frequencyism are in different positions, so if you don&rsquo;t study frequencyism in order to understand Bayesism, that&rsquo;s a wholesaler.
If you didn&rsquo;t want to study frequencyism and were trying to escape to Bayes, sneak in and change your mind lol
If you don&rsquo;t want to rehash that rotten guts, let&rsquo;s just close this article lol</p>
<p>The reason why you should study frequencyism is
In order to deeply understand Bayesianism, it is recommended to study while paying attention to the difference from frequencyism.</p>
<p>Many introductory and beginner articles about Bayes describe the difference from frequencyism.
Knowledge of frequencyism is always useful when reading such things.
This is unavoidable in the history of statistics as I explained earlier.</p>
<p>So, first of all,</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to learn the basics with a book that teaches statistics while actually moving your hands.
The books on the details of frequency-based statistics are enduring.
However, even if you suddenly engage in a small classroom lesson, you will just be broken.</p>
<p>The above book is a content that even beginners of programming can work on, so you can easily imagine statistics.</p>
<p>And now let&rsquo;s move on to a little theoretical study.
personally,</p>

</ul>
<p>Thanks to this book.</p>
<p>It is very helpful even if you are not a psychologist.
Psychology is, in fact, a university question that laid the foundation for progress in statistics.</p>
<p>Is it because it is not clear at first glance whether the operation is effective, and it is necessary to confirm it experimentally.
To put it the other way around, psychology could only be aided by an objectively visible tool called &ldquo;statistics&rdquo; to be recognized as &ldquo;science.&rdquo;
This is also true in medicine, for example, where you want to see the effects of a drug.</p>
<p>The above book also explains how statistics are actually used in psychology, and I think it will be fun to read.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-bayesianism">Introduction to Bayesianism</h2>
<p>By now, you should have been able to understand frequencyism to some extent.
Next, read a bridging book between frequencyism and Bayesism.-<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%83%87%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E8%A7%A3%E6%9E%90%E3%81%AE%E3%81%9F%E3%82%81%E3%81%AE%E7%B5%B1%E8%A8%88%E3%83%A2%E3%83%87%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E5%85%A5%E9%96%80%E2%80%95%E2%80%95%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%E5%8C%96%E7%B7%9A%E5%BD%A2%E3%83%A2%E3%83%87%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BB%E9%9A%8E%E5%B1%A4%E3%83%99%E3%82%A4%E3%82%BA%E3%83%A2%E3%83%87%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BBMCMC-%E7%A2%BA%E7%8E%87%E3%81%A8%E6%83%85%E5%A0%B1%E3%81%AE%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6-%E4%B9%85%E4%BF%9D-%E6%8B%93%E5%BC%A5/dp/400006973X/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_3/355-1889098-6063963?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=400006973X&amp;pd_rd_r=d6348a6c-3a95-4ca8-9c1f-f98017a68392&amp;pd_rd_w=5Rdyl&amp;pd_rd_wg=KsUqF&amp;pf_rd_p=b25bd748-082b-4f2a-b724-125316a35a9c&amp;pf_rd_r=DAJ3VED9BEE81TBADM7R&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=DAJ3VED9BEE81TBADM7R">Introduction to statistical modeling for data analysis: generalized linear model, hierarchical Bayesian model, MCMC (science of probability and information)</a></p>
<p>There is nothing like this book (commonly known as the Midori book) in the positioning of bridging frequencyism and Bayesism.
The book has been acclaimed in many articles other than this one.</p>
<p>You can easily and happily feel the expanse of the world of statistics.
I also read this book and became more interested in statistics.
The statistics, which I thought were tough and unpleasant with only mathematical formulas, suddenly colored when I encountered the Midori book.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that it is a masterpiece that has changed life.</p>
<p>The great thing about Midori books is that</p>
<ol>
<li>the statistical model needed to move beyond just frequencyism</li>
<li>MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo method), an indispensable tool for Bayesianism
It is easy to understand.</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding MCMC is essential to understanding Bayes.
The Markov chain Monte Carlo method, a name that seems to be extremely difficult, was absolutely necessary for commercializing Bayes.
At the same time, this guy is also the person responsible for protecting Bayes&rsquo; chastity until recently, when the power of computers increases.</p>

</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s a step toward actually being able to use Bayes.
Best of all, these books will help you understand MCMC as you move your hands.</p>
<p>No one really uses Bayes and can&rsquo;t program.
Because, as I explained at the beginning, there are many other things that have to be done to work with data in Bayes.
Collecting data, sticking, cleaning up, doing such things and things.</p>
<p>These books are written on the assumption that they can be programmed in their own way, but if you have reached this point, you will surely be able to have a pleasant Bayes life with one hand.</p>
<p>#Summary
Personally, Bayes is very interesting.
The seemingly scholarly study of statistics shows some soft and adorable aspects when learning Bayes.</p>
<p>However, some deep darkness can be seen in that smile&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a peek into the mysterious and fascinating world of Bayesian statistics.</p>
