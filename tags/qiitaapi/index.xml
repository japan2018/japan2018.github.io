      <description>#Introduction  By the way, Advent Calendar is also full of excitement, personally VIPorstockAIItwasamonththatIenjoyedit.Ididn&amp;rsquo;tbuzzatall,butIreallylikeEmployee2vec. Now that I have finished my job, I am writing an article while drinking a highball and thinking about the next topic.
I usually focus on machine learning and computer vision, but once in a while, it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to make something you like, with the pure taste when you start programming like this.

      <description>## Introduction  Qiita&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Beginner&amp;rdquo; tag and &amp;ldquo;New Programmer Support&amp;rdquo; tag articles for beginners As a new QA engineer, everything is very helpful. Unfortunately, the individual tag page only shows trends and new articles, The specifications make it difficult to find good articles in the past. In this article, first use the Qiita API to write an article for beginners (:= Article with the tag &amp;ldquo;Beginner&amp;rdquo; OR &amp;ldquo;Newcomer programmer support&amp;rdquo;) After creating a program to output all, next read each article in the output list in descending order of likes I would like to introduce the God articles that I felt &amp;ldquo;This is really helpful!</description>

      <description>## Introduction  Looking at my post on Qiita, I see three numbers: &amp;ldquo;Page view&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Like&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Stock&amp;rdquo;. I like the &amp;ldquo;likes&amp;rdquo; of all posts on my page, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know the View and Stock of each post or the total. Since I have about 20 posts, I decided to try various methods to get all of my posts, views, likes, and stocks for studying.
When I looked it up, everyone hit the Qiita API in various ways to obtain information, and there are many reference pages, so I will carry out it while checking them.</description>
