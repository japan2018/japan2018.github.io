<pre><code># Overview
</code></pre>
<p>A long time ago, there was a story that said, &ldquo;The most stinky hottogigisu who won the championship <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>&rdquo;.
<code>If it's a crow, invite me to nothingness (Izanae) Totogi (Hototogisu)</code>
It&rsquo;s like <code>Growing my jet black flame, Firetogisu</code>.</p>
<p>I like all the works, but it&rsquo;s useless even if this kind of hand is too far from the original material, and the best taste is to keep the shape and meaning similar to the original material and to have a sense of jerk I wonder if it is.</p>
<p>Therefore, this time, we decided to hold a decisive battle in which &ldquo;the kitchen odorous Hototogisu&rdquo; and the head family Hototogisu Sanku <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> are compared by natural language processing, and the one with the highest degree of similarity wins. ..</p>

If it doesn't ring, swallow it in the abyss! Dark Infinity! !
If you can't cry, shout out, Hototogisu
If it's a cry, I'll wait for an eternal time until I'm crying Hototogisu
If it doesn't ring, let's prove my existence by not ringing Hototogisu
Circular Truth Tiro Finale
The world will be filled with screams of chaos with the end of it
If it doesn't ring, the only beautiful thing in this crazy world is the sad comedy bound by humans and the human comedy named Love Hototogisu
Mourning ── &quot;Never Return&quot;
If it doesn't ring, go crazy in the dark night Hototogisu
If it doesn't ring, Magidoin Perity Cirium Suzaku Falshi's Luci
If it's a ghost, invite it to nothingness (Izanae) Tokitori (Hototogisu)
If it doesn't ring, to the end of the reincarnation Phoenix (Phoenix)
If you don't cry, look like me Hototogisu
If you don't ring, eat the heaven and earth dark slaughter thunder sword
Cry, don't let it down Hototogisu
If it doesn't ring, it sounds like emptiness
If it is a ghost, Prophet and Savior (Amos and Messiah) Hototogisu
If you don't cry, just keep silent and watch me
My requiem dedicated to the King of the Dead (Hototogisu)
If it doesn't ring, go to the crimson universe (Sora) Hototogisu

Don't cry i don't wanna see your tears
If it doesn't ring, I'll destroy everything Hototogisu
Isn't Temee wanting to help Hototogisu? Did you wait a long time? You don't have to kill Hototogisu, you don't have to turn to Hototogisu's enemies, everyone laughs and the highest you want I've been waiting for you all the time! It's not the time to connect until the heroes come! It's not the time for Hideyoshi to appear! Ieyasu, nobody else! I swear, with Temee's hand, to help and show only one bird, don't I?! I wanted to be the protagonist all the time! See warriors like BASARA, bet their lives I wanted to be a warlord who would protect only one bird! If that wasn't the case at all! It wouldn't even start! Don't despair with a little longer prologue!! Let's start adjusting!! Nobunaga!!!
Unleash the faint and eternal death, destroy all that is full of deception

<p>#Implementation
<a href="https://api.ce-cotoha.com/contents/referenceprovidedby%5BCOTOHAAPI%5D(https://api.ce-cotoha.com/contents/index.html)Use/apireference.html#similarity">Similarity calculation API</a>.</p>
<p>The original story of Hototogisu is the following three works.
Nobunaga: If it doesn&rsquo;t ring, kill it.
Hideyoshi: If it doesn&rsquo;t ring, let&rsquo;s ring it Hottogisu
Ieyasu: If it doesn&rsquo;t ring, wait until it rings.</p>
<p>First, we will compare each of the above three phrases with the &ldquo;Kitchen&rsquo;s Stinking Hototogisu Works&rdquo; one by one, and create a ranking similar to each daimyo.
After that, by summing up the respective similarity scores, the “winning stinking Hototogisu overall winning work” with the highest similarity to the original story is determined. (That is, the one with a high degree of similarity on average wins.)</p>

<p>#Commentary (Summary)
For that reason, the overall victory was a slight difference **&lsquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t ring, it&rsquo;s Hototogisu crazy in the dark night!&rsquo;
Although it is simple, it has a &ldquo;likeness&rdquo; and a high affinity with Nobunaga, so I think it is a reasonable place. The average sync rate was as high as <strong>99.4%</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;If I&rsquo;m a thug, I&rsquo;ll wait for eternity until I&rsquo;m hot, Hototogisu&rsquo;</strong> It&rsquo;s a stable thing that Ieyasu added only 5+2 letters, so he always keeps the third place or less. Because of the increased number of notes, I was put in second place overall. I think the point of the evaluation is that the similarity was high even though the kanji for &ldquo;Tenku&rdquo; was different.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;No sound! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! It was surprising that&rsquo;</strong> was evaluated. Only the first three letters match, but the synchronization rate with Hideyoshi was <strong>99.9147%</strong>, and this time we were at the top of all the similarity scores. **Are you okay? **</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t ring, Magidoin Perity Cirium Suzaku Falsi&rsquo;s Luci&rsquo; had a strong presence, but it was a pity that it fell to 5th place overall. Perhaps the reason for the high evaluation was that Suzaku and Tokitori had a high affinity, because it was a Joker-like existence that was too similar to any ward because Falsi&rsquo;s Luci was too unclear. I don&rsquo;t know, but it was a great fight. It&rsquo;s actually Peri</strong>City**Rium.</p>
<p>By the way, my personal favorite is <strong>&lsquo;My requiem for the King without the soul&rsquo; (Hototogisu)'</strong>, but it was judged to be indistinct and was the third from the bottom. **Well that&rsquo;s right. **</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all from the scene.</p>
