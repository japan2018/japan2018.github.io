      <description># I want to run the toio core cube on a familiar PC  The toio core cube is a &amp;ldquo;very cute&amp;rdquo; two-wheeled robot that can be controlled by BLE communication. https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/
The other day, I tried to write a story of trying to move the toio core cube directly using BLE communication with a smartphone, but this time using a personal computer I will move the toio core cube.</description>

      <description>## I was annoyed by ImportError  Install python with homebrew and django with pip. However, it fails when the server starts.
$ python manage.py runserver  ImportError: No module named django.core.management
 Actually, Python is included in the Mac from the beginning Launch the Terminal app and check the version
$ python --version  Python 2.7.5
 I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice this, and I thought it was Python installed with homebrew.</description>
