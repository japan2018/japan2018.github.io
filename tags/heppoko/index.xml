      <description>&amp;lt;img width=&amp;quot;610&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;eyecatch.png&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/634341/275b16c8-3136-198f-fa76-a17a4cbb41e1.png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;  YouDev has been released. 2020.5.01
YouDev is a service that focuses on individual developers to let them know more about them (I want to know&amp;hellip;).
Even if the service is recognized, I think that the developers have not hit the spot, so individual developers may not only appeal the services released by themselves, but also the developers themselves. I created it.
I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for individual developers, so I&amp;rsquo;m an individual developer!</description>
