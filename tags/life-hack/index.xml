      <description>What do you guys do when learning models with machine learning?  Did you just look at the log output to the console? &amp;ldquo;Oh, it was lower than I expected!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Oh, the accuracy is getting worse, do your best!!&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly fun to think, though.
But when I cheered up, the model doesn&amp;rsquo;t do its best, and there is no dramatic development, so it&amp;rsquo;s a waste of time to look at it.</description>
