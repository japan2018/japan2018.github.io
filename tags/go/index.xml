      <description># Start a dash from &amp;quot;Development environment + container containing all projects&amp;quot; with Remote Conainer of VS Code! ?  Are you using VS Code Remote Conainer for development? You can use Remote SSH if you just enter an existing container, but let&amp;rsquo;s use Remote Container as a &amp;ldquo;part of local development environment&amp;rdquo;, rather as ** local development environment = Remote Container **. It&amp;rsquo;s Reiwa! ~~ (It&amp;rsquo;s been 2 years already&amp;hellip;?</description>

      <description>This article is on December 24 (Tue) of [DeNA Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/dena).  Introduction I usually use Perl, but I put together it for the purpose of learning Go and reviewing Python. Python&amp;rsquo;s grammar is very simple, so I thought it would be easier to learn Go by the difference. I&amp;rsquo;ve written as much as possible, but I think there are various shortages. Please note.
Comment First, how to write a comment.</description>

      <description>[VISITS Advent Calendar](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/visits) is also less than a week left.  Looking back, I found that articles in a very wide range of fields were written, and even the people inside the company were often surprised that &amp;ldquo;this person had this kind of technology.&amp;rdquo;
For me, this is the final article for the 2019 Advent Calendar!
TL; DR Some of our products implement API server in Go language.
The author, who has been familiar with Python for a long time, will write about Go language for about a month and a half, but I will write an article about Differences between Go language and Python that I found by writing it carefully at work.</description>

      <description>## 02. “Patrol Car” + “Taxi” = “Pattokka See”  Get the character string &amp;ldquo;Patto Kukashi&amp;rdquo; by alternately connecting the letters &amp;ldquo;Patrol Car&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Taxi&amp;rdquo; from the beginning.
###Go
package main import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; ) func main() { var p1 string = &amp;#34;police car&amp;#34;; var p2 string = &amp;#34;Taxi&amp;#34;; var result string; // make the character array p1s := strings.Split(p1,&amp;#34;&amp;#34;); p2s := strings.Split(p2,&amp;#34;&amp;#34;); // Array number loop (match with &amp;#34;patrol car&amp;#34; because it has the same number of characters.</description>

      <description>When you touch a variety of languages, the detailed characteristics of the language and the usage of symbols are getting messed up, regardless of the important characteristics of the language. How do you write that this is this language? It often happens. Even though I used to use a language that I used to use a lot, I sometimes feel shocked that I have forgotten it even after a short distance.</description>

      <description>Premise   My current affiliation is the system development department, and the department that refurbishes and maintains existing packages. We are active in a cycle of renovating and releasing our long-lived in-house package (LAMP configuration) once every two months. The members of the development department range from those with deep experience as engineers to employees who are new graduates.
In that situation, I checked the rating using Paiza, and it is a report and impression.</description>
