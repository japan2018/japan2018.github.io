      <description>Hi, this is [Muscle Training Clinical Engineering Engineer ken](https://twitter.com/ce_fitness_note).  This is my first post on Qiita.
I usually use C# to develop medical systems. I decided to focus on machine learning, so I started learning python.
Even though I learned about it, I went around Progate&amp;rsquo;s python course, but I will briefly summarize the differences between C# and how to write.
If you usually use C#, C++, VB and want to learn python from now on, I think that learning will be better if you know the difference between the two in advance.</description>
