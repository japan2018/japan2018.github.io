      <description>#1.Introduction  ##(1. Purpose If you want to do machine learning, anyone can use scikit-learn etc. to implement it relatively easily. However, in order to achieve results at work or to improve your level, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand the background, but I got this result&amp;rdquo; I think it&amp;rsquo;s clearly weak.
This time, we will focus on &amp;ldquo;correlation&amp;rdquo;**.
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about decorrelation, why do you do it?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;How do you use it?</description>

      <guid>https://memotut.com/application-of-affine-transformation-by-tensor-from-basics-to-object-detection-11cbd/</guid>
      <description>This article is about simplifying preprocessing by using affine transformation with tensors. The affine transformation can be applied to images, but the same transformation can be applied to annotations such as Bounding Box. You can also apply different transformations to one object at the same time by extending it to a tensor.  Affine transformation basics The affine transformation represents the movement of points in the following formula.
$$\begin{bmatrix}x&amp;rsquo; \\ y&amp;rsquo;\\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}a &amp;amp; b &amp;amp; c \\ d &amp;amp; e &amp;amp; f \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \tag{1}$$</description>

      <guid>https://memotut.com/simultaneous-visualization-of-data-and-understanding-of-correlation-649cf/</guid>
      <description>#Introduction  When analyzing data, I think you will visualize the data using graphs. At that time, it would be convenient if the statistics showing the correlation between two variables could be displayed at the same time. Therefore, we made it possible to display the appropriate statistics on the appropriate graph according to the content of the variable (category or numerical value).
Review so far I will summarize the appropriate graphing methods by content of variables and the statistics that show the correlation, which have been described so far.</description>

      <description>Hi, this is [Muscle Training Clinical Engineering Engineer ken](https://twitter.com/ce_fitness_note).  This is my first post on Qiita.
I usually use C# to develop medical systems. I decided to focus on machine learning, so I started learning python.
Even though I learned about it, I went around Progate&amp;rsquo;s python course, but I will briefly summarize the differences between C# and how to write.
If you usually use C#, C++, VB and want to learn python from now on, I think that learning will be better if you know the difference between the two in advance.</description>

It was an interesting library, so in this article I will explain how to use PyCaret. **PyCaret is a Python library that enables data pre-processing, visualization, and model development with a few lines of code in machine learning model development. **
PyCaret is a Python wrapper for some of the major machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  I am currently a M2 student majoring in CS. I usually write machine learning code in PyTorch. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to write for the time being. PyTorch is said to be &amp;ldquo;Define by Run&amp;rdquo;**, and what is good at the same time when the calculation graph and data are sent is that it is easy to debug because you can check the calculation results on the way. As a PyTorch believer, I need to write code in TensorFlow this time, so I will keep a memo so that I don&amp;rsquo;t forget the know-how at that time.</description>

You can tune and predict from preprocessing without writing 10 lines of code! Although there are many parts that I have not understood yet such as arguments, I decided to write the article of PyCaret first. If you have any notes, please comment.

      <description>#Introduction  **A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements of the matrix are 0. It is used in a wide range of fields such as numerical calculation, machine learning, and graph theory (I think). Since most of the matrix is 0, if you devise to ignore 0, you can perform matrix calculation at high speed. For example, if you use a large-scale sparse matrix (nearly 90% is 0) (1 million rows x 1 million columns) and only use non-zero parts, the calculation time will be about 1/10 and the calculation can be completed quickly.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  In distance learning (metric learning) using deep learning, similarities (and dissimilarities) between images are used by using Contrastive Loss and Triplet Loss.) Is widely used, but it is also known that it is difficult to combine and select learning data, and learning itself is difficult in many cases. For that reason, various improvements and ideas have been proposed so far. However, recently, metric learning, which can learn based on the Softmax function as if it is a general class classification task without the difficulty of selecting learning data like this, has been attracting attention.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  The news is about the news that Carlos Ghosn, the former chairman of Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., broke bail conditions and traveled to Lebanon. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking for a long time, but it&amp;rsquo;s similar to Mr. Bean&amp;hellip; Left: [Carlos Ghosn](https://www.google.com/search?q=Carlos+Ghosn&amp;amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNS1gsNQxqfqi7GRWUUeSSZ6CRix8w:1577813710879&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;Ah&amp;amp;EqjQAQBQ&amp;amp;QAQBQBQ&amp;amp;QAQBQ&amp;amp;QB Right: [Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson)](https://www.google.com/search?q=rowan+atkinson&amp;amp;biw=1386&amp;amp;bih=710&amp;amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNTsdddnLF7jgPr9RTePeEMGgREpyA:1577813660092&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;saQ&amp;amp;isch&amp;amp;saq
It was a year-end and New Year holiday, so I made a little classifier using a neural network. If you google it, a lot of images of the two people will appear, so it was good for CNN, but This time, as another approach, I would like to perform classification based on the position of landmarks on the face.</description>

      <description># What is a classification problem  The classification problem is to classify data into several categories and is one of the typical methods of machine learning.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a purchasing site as an example. Predict whether a user will buy or not buy a new product based on the user&amp;rsquo;s purchasing information. Classification into two categories (classes) is called binary classification.
Classification predictions with more than two classes are called multiclass classifications.</description>

      <description>This article is from [Furukawa Lab, Advent_calendar Day 23](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/flab).  #Introduction
GPLVM is an unsupervised learning method that uses Gaussian process (GP) and can estimate low-dimensional manifolds whose data are distributed in high-dimensional space. The main attraction of GPLVM is that the model is very simple and highly expandable, and theoretically easy to handle. In fact, it has been extended to more complex situations such as Bayesian estimation of hyperparameters, time series data analysis 1, multiview analysis 2, and tensor decomposition 3.</description>

But when I cheered up, the model doesn&amp;rsquo;t do its best, and there is no dramatic development, so it&amp;rsquo;s a waste of time to look at it.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone.  I started Qiita from today.
As a machine learning engineer, I am usually involved in AI development and web application development.
In private, I became a newbie daddy. I am writing an article while holding my eldest son who will be 4 months (laugh)
As a motivation to write an article, I have been working on machine learning since 2017 when there was no reference book yet, I always feel that the experience of having a hard time learning machine learning is useful for someone.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Deep learning is a method recently used to clean dirty images, remove graffiti from images, and restore poorly-zoomed images.
The principle is simple, just input a noisy image to the converter and output a beautiful image.
Such converters are often made up of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
In this article, I will try to implement such CNN with pytorch and see the results.
There are various CNN models like this, but this time I will try with three CNN models and compare the results.</description>

      <description># Overview  This is an article about clipping each value held by tensor handled by TensorFlow. Specifically, it is an explanation and implementation example of the tf.clip_by... method.
Why do you do this in the first place? I think there are various uses, but in machine learning related calculations (especially gradient calculation), which is the main purpose of TensorFlow, there are many cases where the sense of scale of the handled variables is different and it can not be calculated well.</description>

      <description># Target of this article  Purpose of writing the article The words AI and deep learning have been around for a long time, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think there are many people who really understand their meaning. I think it&amp;rsquo;s very dangerous to have a debate about what AI can do, as in Japan today.
I think the reason why there is such a debate about AI in this way is that you do not fully understand the mathematical basis of machine learning.</description>

      <description>This article is posted on [IQ1&#39;s 2nd Advent Calendar 2019](https://adventar.org/calendars/4711).  IQ1 machine learning For machine learning, data preprocessing and model hyper search are inevitable. However, I have an IQ of 1, so I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do it if I can do preprocessing of data and high-para search. If you put the preprocessing of data into this modern gradient boosting tree system algorithm (such as lightgbm), you can handle the missing values as they are and you do not have to preprocess the categorical variables, so it will be a world relatively friendly to IQ1.</description>

      <description>#1.First of all  Since I started studying machine learning, I tried Kaggle&amp;rsquo;s tutorial for beginners, Titanic.
At first, I tried to play around with the feature amount on my own, referring to Japanese Web information, but even if the training data showed good accuracy, when I submitted the test data, the accuracy did not rise as expected, It was difficult to break the wall of 80% and I was in agony.</description>

      <description># My background  Amazon? Ah, you know, you know, a mail order app. Not long ago, knowledge about Amazon was that much. Of course, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know AWS.
I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed as an information undergraduate student. 
However, as a 3rd year university student, I was introduced to the lab and learned about AWS. In addition, I am addicted to the topic &amp;ldquo;Atsuhiko Nakata&amp;rsquo;s YouTube University&amp;rdquo;, which is a hot topic in this street.</description>

The content is &amp;ldquo;3.4.2 Gaussian Process Regression Calculation&amp;rdquo; in Chapter 3. Deer is a landmark. It is easy to understand and highly recommended.
What is the Gauss process? First of all, to explain the Gaussian process in one word,
At Y=f(X) &amp;ldquo;If input X is similar, output Y is similar.&amp;quot;
It is a tool for mathematically expressing that property.</description>
