      <description>As a hobby, I personally developed a web service that AI automatically marks the readability of characters when I write them in a browser, and released it about 2 weeks ago: relaxed:  []((https://letters.choo.works/) Letters-AI handwriting scoring app
The core technology is front-end implementation with DeepLearning image recognition and Preact. In this article, we will describe Service outline, technical details, and impressions regarding the developed application.
Service overview Function introduction Since it has a small number of pages and is lightweight, it is probably faster to see the application regarding the function, but I will explain the function including an overview of the technology used with screenshots.</description>

      <description># Overview  I am actively using GCP, but I thought that Cloud run + Firebase would be good if I wanted to make a service cheaply and easily, so I summarized it. As for maintainability, I think Cloud run is better when comparing Cloud run and Cloud Functions.
Development environment list  Source Repository Cloud build Cloud run Firebase(hosting)  #Introduction First, enable the service in the above environment. The minimum required IAM for gcloud is as follows.</description>

      <description>[Official Tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/tutorials/transformer?hl=ja) If you proceeded according to the street, it didn&#39;t work, so take a note.  In this article, we will explain how to launch CloudTPU and GCE VM instances and build an English-Japanese translation model using transformer, which is one of the NMT models.
Premise  You have already created a project on Google Cloud Platform Billing is enabled for created projects  Cloud Console In Cloud Console, enter the following to launch a new CloudTPU and GCE VM instance.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  This article is the 23rd day article of Classi Advent Calendar 2019.
Hello, this is @tomoyanamekawa of data AI part of Classi. Usually, I mainly build a data analysis platform on GCP.
Recently, there was something like &amp;ldquo;I want to divide the data in BigQuery into files according to the value inside and save it in GCS&amp;rdquo;, and at that time I was indebted to Cloud Dataflow. There seems to be demand for other people, and there are few implementation examples in Python, so I will summarize.</description>

      <description>#GCP had a great feature added  Previously, I wrote an article Easily build a GCP environment for Kaggle. This time, I found an easier way to build it, so I&amp;rsquo;ll write it as an improved version of the previous article. A notebook function has been added to the lower AI platform. What this means is that you can get it ready for use without having to do the work to make the jupyter notebook introduced in the previous article.</description>

      <title>Aiming to acquire AWS certification, give it to engineers who are not good at English! Take a screenshot of the English site, extract the text data from the image file, and then try translating it ~ Difference between AWS and Google Cloud API ~</title>

      <description>#Background  How are AWS certified measures taken? AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solution Architect â€“ Associates have a copy of the test book and a practice test, making it an easy environment for studying the test. However, after the developer-associate, there are few Japanese language study books, so if you want to do a mock exam, UdemyandWhizlabs.However,mostofthepracticetestsonthesesitesareinEnglish.(AsofDecember03,2019,thereisoneJapanesemockexaminUdemy)
Difference between Udemy and Whizlabs I thought it would be better to do a lot of mock exams, so I tried English mock exams at Udemy and Whizlabs.</description>
