      <description>## Trigger  Do you sell anything you no longer need using Mercari? I also sell unnecessary books in Mercari, but since they are old reference books and study books, they are hard to sell. .. ..
Mercari will offer a &amp;ldquo;sellable price&amp;rdquo; when listing. However, if I set it to a high price, I can&amp;rsquo;t sell it, and if it&amp;rsquo;s too cheap, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve lost something.
Before setting the price of an exhibit, I conduct a search to find out what the real market price is.</description>
