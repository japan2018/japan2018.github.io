      <description>I tried rebuilding!  Rebuild Django development environment with Docker! ! ! ! 
#Introduction
Team development&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to build an environment&amp;hellip; At that time, use Docker (miscellaneous).
This article is a repost of what I gave to qrunchLet&amp;rsquo;s build a Django/postgreSQL/gunicorn/nginx development environment using Docker and Docker-compose, which are very convenient for team development! !
The whole flow is based on almost the following sites, but I intend to make the article easy to understand, such as putting comments in almost all lines of the configuration file etc.</description>

      <description>I have created docker-compose in a form that can be used even for projects that have already been created, so I will summarize the specifications in an article.  ** Please see How to Use on GitHub → GitHub**
(I&amp;rsquo;m sorry if you change the DB from the default sqlite&amp;hellip;
The deployment environment is Django＋Nginx＋Gunicorn.
Overview Please refer to the README on GitHub for how to use the link provided above.</description>
