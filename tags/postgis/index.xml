      <description>New Corona... The spread of infection is not stopping...  I was thinking that I would like to put some data on a map and visualize it as a fledgling GIS shop, but I was afraid that most of the open data was collected in PDF format.

People can see where they ran, but I can&amp;rsquo;t manage to make a beautiful track&amp;hellip; However, I do not have data such as G sensor and steering, and even if there is it, it seems difficult for an amateur to correct it.</description>
