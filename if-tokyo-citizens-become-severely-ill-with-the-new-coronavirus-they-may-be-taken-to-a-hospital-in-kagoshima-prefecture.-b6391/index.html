<p>#Introduction</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>
Infectious disease designated medical institutions are tight, and it is extremely difficult to secure sufficient beds to accommodate severely ill persons. In various places, measures have been taken to treat patients with mild illness at hotels, homes, etc. in order to secure beds for those with severe illness.</li>
<li><strong>Task</strong>  <br>
With the spread of new coronavirus infections, it is important to how quickly the severely ill persons who occur at the same time can be transported to designated medical institutions for infectious diseases. In addition, it is desirable to keep the distance as short as possible in order to avoid the risk of infection caused by transportation and further aggravation.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>  <br>
-To understand the current risk of medical collapse by visualizing the tightness of infectious disease designated medical institutions due to the spread of new coronavirus infection
-Judging whether or not a bed can be secured to accept severely ill persons when all mildly ill persons are treated at a hotel or home
-To construct a mathematical model that minimizes the total transport distance of the critically ill and consider its behavior
-Based on the above analysis results, increase or decrease one&rsquo;s sense of crisis for the new coronavirus
(** In conclusion, Tokyo residents were transported to Kagoshima prefecture, and the sense of crisis exploded.)</li>
</ul>
<p>My sense of crisis (5-level rating): ☆☆☆☆☆ (Default: Everyone is Corona Corona Noisy)</p>
<h1 id="current-status-of-medical-collapse-risk">Current status of medical collapse risk</h1>
<p>We will visualize the relationship between the number of beds and the number of infected people at designated medical institutions for infectious diseases by prefecture, and consider the current risk of medical collapse. For the number of beds by prefecture and the number of infected people by prefecture, we used only <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SPqnO0yLn8ubax96sDJZVDcjAH8QT1suLCIgroPGVHY/edit#gid=0">New coronavirus patient open data</a>.Obtainedfrom<a href="https://www.stopcovid19.jp/">NewCoronaVirusCountermeasureDashboard</a> at 20:00 on April 23, 2020.</p>
<img width="835" alt="image1.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/456896/839b6644-48a4-3b75-8815-65d699775bc2.png">
<p>This is a heat map (left figure) of the bed utilization rates by prefecture when all infected persons used designated medical institutions for infectious diseases, and the top 10 (center table) and Worst 10 (right table) bed utilization rates.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are many prefectures with 100% or more, and there is no choice but to take measures to cure the mildly ill at the hotel, home, etc.**</li>
<li>Toyama and Okinawa, which have a small number of beds, are also in the top 10, and it is not only the population problem that has a high risk of medical collapse **</li>
</ul>
<p>My sense of crisis: ★☆☆☆☆ (I feel like I&rsquo;m in a bad mood for the time being)</p>
<h1 id="whether-to-secure-a-hospital-bed-that-accepts-severely-ill-people">Whether to secure a hospital bed that accepts severely ill people</h1>
<p>From the current state of the risk of medical collapse, we have found that the atmosphere is rather naive. Next, what is worrisome is that, even if all mild illnesses are treated at a hotel or at home, in the first place **is it possible to secure enough beds to accommodate the severely ill?</p>
<p><a href="http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51">Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team (2020)</a>reportedthattheChineseinfected(4Ofthe4,672people), 81% were mild and 19% were serious and serious.</p>
<p>Based on this report, we will simulate the availability of beds. Assuming that randomly selected 19% of all infected people are critically ill, calculate the bed usage rate for each prefecture. Let&rsquo;s consider the bed utilization rate in each prefecture when the random number is changed and repeated 1000 times.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/456896/58d63ccf-b335-8df7-dfbe-1e211ca0cf54.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>The heat map (left figure) of average bed utilization rates by prefecture of the simulation results and the average top 10 (center table)/Worst 10 (right table) of bed utilization rates.</p>
<ul>
<li>The average hospital bed utilization rate is over 100% in 9 prefectures, ** Even severely ill people may not be able to be admitted to designated medical institutions for infectious diseases in their residential areas**</li>
<li><strong>In the worst case, you may have to transport to a neighboring prefecture</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>My sense of crisis: ★★★☆☆ (The average bed usage rate exceeds 100% in Tokyo&hellip;)</p>
<p>#Severelyilltransportmodel
From the simulation results, it turned out that the atmosphere was awful. Next, I&rsquo;m worried about what to do for seriously ill persons who could not be admitted to a designated infectious disease medical institution in their area. This time, it is a bit of a bit of a bad idea, but we will consider transporting it to another prefecture. There may be a lot of pros and cons, but there is a lot of pros and cons, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%88%E3%83%AD%E3%83%83%E3%82%B3%E5%95%8F%E9%A1%8C">Trolley problem</a> I had no choice but to do this.</p>
<p>In order to avoid infection risk and further aggravation due to transportation, it is considered that the distance should be as short as possible, so we will consider a mathematical model that minimizes the total transportation distance of severely ill persons.</p>
<details><summary>If you are interested in the details of the mathematical model, click here</summary><div>
<img width="415" alt="Screenshots 2020-04-23 21.45.23.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/456896/cb11ca60-3417-f20e-cdbd-da3982bb04c7.png">
<ul>
<li>The critically ill person set is $I$ and the infectious disease designated medical institution set is $J$.</li>
<li>Carry infectious disease designated medical institution $ j(\in J)$ to the critically ill person $ i(\in I)$.</li>
<li>The distance when the critically ill $i$ moves to the designated infectious disease medical institution $j$ is $d_{ij}$.</li>
<li>If severely ill $i$ is assigned to infectious disease designated medical institution $j$, $x_{ij}=1$, otherwise $x_{ij}=0$.</li>
<li>Find $x_{ij}$ that minimizes the total transport distance.</li>
<li>The maximum number of beds $C_j$ at the designated infectious disease medical institution $j$ shall not be exceeded.</li>
<li>All critically ill persons will be sent to $j$, a designated medical institution for infectious diseases.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<p>As a numerical experiment, we optimize the delivery destination of 19% of severely ill patients randomly selected from all infected people. However, because there is insufficient data on location information, there is only one location information for severely ill persons in the prefectural office of the place of residence, one infectious disease designated medical institution in each prefecture, and the distance is <a href="https://qiita.com/r-fuji/items/99ca549b963cedc106ab">Vincenty Law</a></p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/456896/8dabdfcb-5934-5bf4-9f66-43666a05fdcc.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Heat map (left/left center figure) of average bed utilization rates by prefectures before and after optimization, summary statistics of transport distance (right center table), and distribution (right figure).</p>
<ul>
<li>The bed occupancy rate outside of Kagoshima prefecture and Okinawa prefecture is all 100%, and if the number of infected people does not stop increasing, medical treatment will be completely collapsed **</li>
<li>The total transport distance was 201940km, 187km per person.</li>
<li>While there are many seriously ill persons who are transported to designated medical institutions for infectious diseases in the residential area, ** Some severely ill persons are transported by several hundred km units**</li>
</ul>
<p>My sense of crisis: ★★★★☆ (Isn&rsquo;t it so bad that Japan is bright red?!)</p>
<p>#About transportation destinations for severely ill people
From the simulation results, it was found that the atmosphere is realistic. Next, I&rsquo;m worried about <strong>how the severely ill people moved</strong>. Visualize the transition network diagram of the critically ill.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/456896/60180193-6897-b0fd-709e-6c799a79fa65.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Tokyo&rsquo;s severely ill people are being transported to designated medical institutions for infectious diseases in Hokkaido in the north and Kagoshima prefecture in the south</li>
<li><strong>It was found that there are cases where prioritizing acceptance of other prefectures in order to minimize the total transport distance</strong></li>
<li>** The maximum transport distance of 962 km is when seriously ill people in Tokyo are transported to Kagoshima Prefecture, and there are 31 people **</li>
</ul>
<p>My sense of crisis: ★★★★★ (I feel tired to move 962km even when I am fine)</p>
