      <description>## Assumption  The command sample is executed in the Windows+Anaconda environment. In addition, some paths such as the account name are shown as subscripts, so please replace them according to each environment.
#Conclusion I would like to tell you from the conclusion earlier, due to the specification change of Google image search, the scraping of the official tool is not working properly. Some people have posted the patch PR to the official GigHub, so if you download that source and run it, you can get it to work properly.</description>
