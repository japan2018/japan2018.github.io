<pre><code>In this article, I will introduce the working style of Ogawa, who belongs to the development team of the AI Technology Department.
</code></pre>
<p>This article is an introduction for me.</p>
<p>The way you work depends on the member, and also on the family structure.
I am married but I have no children.</p>
<p>Also, different departments work differently.</p>
<p>In this article, I will introduce the working week for me (Yutaro Ogawa) of AI Technology Department.</p>
<h2 id="why-dont-you-change-jobs-from-your-current-company">Why don&rsquo;t you change jobs from your current company?</h2>
<p>Occasionally, &ldquo;Why does Ogawa work at Dentsu International Information Service (ISID)? Why not change jobs?&rdquo;
I was asked,</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I haven&rsquo;t changed my job at the moment is</p>
<p>&ldquo;An environment where ISID is very easy to work, and it is easy to balance work and private (self-study)&rdquo;</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>I will introduce the actual situation.</p>
<p>##&ldquo;basic rule&rdquo;
First of all, the basic rules of the company,</p>
<ol>
<li>Scheduled working time is 7 hours</li>
<li>Regular standard working hours are from 9:30 to 17:30 (1 hour break included)</li>
</ol>
<p>is.</p>
<p>Most companies have a standard working time of 8 hours (7 hours 45 minutes), but
ISID is 7 hours.</p>
<p>Compared to 8 hours, I work less than 1 hour every day.</p>
<p>If it is 1 hour x 20 days/month, it will be 20 hours less per month.</p>
<p>Image-wise,</p>
<p>It feels like &ldquo;more holidays every month, about 3 days compared to an 8 hour company&rdquo;.</p>
<p>By that time, I can take time to study various things outside working hours,
I like this rule of working hours because it is easy for me to grow.</p>
<p>Overtime hours are
Looking at openwork (formerly vorkers), it says 37 hours a month,
<a href="https://www.vorkers.com/company.php?m_id=a0910000000GVZZ">https://www.vorkers.com/company.php?m_id=a0910000000GVZZ</a></p>
<p>According to the official figures, the company-wide average is 25.5 hours/month (FY2018 actual).
(ISID official <a href="https://www.isid.co.jp/neo-pro/faq/">https://www.isid.co.jp/neo-pro/faq/</a>)</p>
<p>My overtime hours are basically about 25 to 30 hours.</p>
<p>Also, since overtime hours are calculated monthly,</p>
<p>For example,
Work 9 hours on Monday (2 hours overtime),
On Tuesdays, I work two hours overtime the previous day, work short hours, work five hours, and return.
(If possible due to work schedule)</p>
<h2 id="flex-system">&ldquo;Flex system&rdquo;</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the standard working time is 7 hours, but there is only the core time due to the flex system.
Core time varies by department.</p>
<p>The core time of my AI Technology Department is 9:30-12:00.
Therefore, basically, everyone comes to work at 9:30 and returns from around 17:30 to 18:30.</p>
<p>In the case of the department that entered when I joined the company, the core time was 13:00-15:30,
Many people came from 11 o&rsquo;clock or noon (that&rsquo;s why everyone worked late into the night)</p>
<p>In my case, it&rsquo;s morning type so that people around me call me &ldquo;Grandpa&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Basically, I work from 7:30 in the morning, work for 8 hours with 7 hours + 1 hour for a break, and leave the company at 15:30.</p>
<p>(When I finished work at 15:30 and made a phone call to my parents&rsquo; house on my way home,
Parents worry that &ldquo;Are you really working?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="telework">&ldquo;Telework&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Basically, you can get 2 days of telework a week.
If you want to telework more than 3 days a week, you can do it with the permission of your supervisor.</p>
<p>Basically, I do telework 2 days a week.</p>
<p>Also, when the week with high load continues,
In the next week, I will work from home for the entire week, and sometimes I will work while resting my body.</p>
<p>In the case of teleworking, the question is, &ldquo;How do you handle internal meetings and meetings with customers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>First, there is a &ldquo;Regular Meeting&rdquo; every week.</p>
<p>The regular meetings of the department are basically telework participants.
The manager then shares the meeting materials with everyone on the screen and advances the meeting.</p>
<p>In the first place, since there are members of the Kansai branch office, the telephone call is the basic.
Therefore, there is no problem in teleworking.</p>
<p>In-house meetings are the same.</p>
<p>In addition, in the case of meetings with customers,
・A certain degree of relationship
・Movement time is a waste for each other
・The quality of the meeting output does not deteriorate even if you are not in the actual place.</p>
<p>In that case, basically, we will hold meetings, report on progress, and give consultations via telecan.</p>
<p>However, in-house meetings, customer meetings,
・When I need to facilitate
・When it is very important
・If the quality of the output of the meeting is better if you are real
Is
I usually attend a meeting, not a telephone call.</p>
<p>To the end, it is a culture that &ldquo;if you can use a telephone, the efficiency and the quality of the conference will not deteriorate.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="finally-my-way-of-working-ogawa">Finally, my way of working (Ogawa)</h2>
<p>Recently (March 20th), there are many team product development and customer consulting projects.</p>
<p>Telework on Monday and Friday,
Team up on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays for team development
It is a style.</p>
<p>The timetable is as follows
(There are some differences, but it is like this when simplified)</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/576009/a80fcd36-89b4-a951-a8be-a3c6b04ade71.png" alt="schedule.png"></p>
<p>The green part of the table is working hours.</p>
<p>I will come to work on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.
At 7:30 to 9:30 in the morning, when nobody comes to the office, I concentrate on my work.
Team development from 9:30 to 17:00.
From 17:00 to 17:30 we will have 1on1 with the members.</p>
<p>Then, over the past 3 days, I work overtime for 2 hours, so I have 6 hours overtime a week.</p>
<p>Therefore, we will reduce our work hours by 3 hours on Monday and Friday.</p>
<p>I am teleworking (at home) on Mondays and Fridays, and work from 7:30 to 11:30 for 4 hours.</p>
<p>Of course, depending on the situation of the customer and the department,
・Telework (home) in the morning and work from the afternoon
Or
・Go to meetings at customers
There is also such a thing, and it is a little more flexible.</p>
<p>However, the basic pattern is as shown in the table above.</p>
<p>At 11:30 on Mondays and Fridays, my work will be finished at home, so
After that, I work out in the gym, read at a coffee shop, write a new book, and study what I wanted to study.</p>
<p>Since family time is at night, the family is the priority.</p>
<p>Among the Dentsu International Information Services (ISID), the AI Technology Department and development team to which I belong is
It is a team with few faces with customers.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is relatively easy to assemble the way of working, and it is such a way of working.</p>
<p>However, it is flexible because some members of the same team usually come to the office every day at 9:30 and return after 17:30.</p>
<p>(However, even if you are unable to come to work due to being locked down due to a new corona, etc., we will continue to work with telework and prepare for not disturbing customers and surroundings)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for the introduction of the work week for me (Yutaro Ogawa) in the AI Technology Department.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this.</p>
