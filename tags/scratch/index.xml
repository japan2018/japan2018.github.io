      <description># Why do you have a lightweight HTTP server?   Scratch 2 offline version can read additional block from JSON format file. The block makes a GET request to an HTTP server outside of Scratch. You can extend the functionality of Scratch by launching a helper app that waits for GET. However, creating a thread for each request that arrives in large numbers from a Scratch loop seems to have a large overhead.</description>
