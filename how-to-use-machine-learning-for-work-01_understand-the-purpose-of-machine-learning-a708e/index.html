</p>
<pre><code>Hello everyone.
</code></pre>
<p>I started Qiita from today.</p>
<p>As a machine learning engineer, I am usually involved in AI development and web application development.</p>
<p>In private, I became a newbie daddy.
I am writing an article while holding my eldest son who will be 4 months (laugh)</p>
<p>As a motivation to write an article, I have been working on machine learning since 2017 when there was no reference book yet,
I always feel that the experience of having a hard time learning machine learning is useful for someone.</p>
<p>So I decided to write an article that could support people who are aiming for career advancement.
The theme of the first post that should be commemorated was &ldquo;*What was machine learning made for?&rdquo; **&ldquo;is.</p>
<p>No matter how good a reference book may be, I think <strong>you can&rsquo;t learn anything without knowing the purpose of machine learning</strong>.
First, let&rsquo;s understand the basic picture of everything.</p>
<p>Since various information is also sent on SNS, please feel free to read the article.
<a href="https://twitter.com/Koji21825331">Twitter account &ldquo;Saku731&rdquo;</a> would be happy to follow you.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-machine-learning">What is machine learning?</h2>
<p>I suppose everyone has such an experience.</p>
<p>** &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I learned from machine learning&rdquo; **
** &ldquo;Logistics regression, decision tree, support vector machine, too many methods&rdquo; **</p>
<p>One of the pain points when learning machine learning is <strong>the number of techniques to remember</strong>.
It is necessary to understand 5 to 10 methods just by reading one reference book.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, &ldquo;how&rdquo; and &ldquo;how&rdquo; to use these methods **
I have never met a reference book that has been carefully explained.</p>
<p>On the contrary, why not understand why there are various methods ** and their common points **?
That person can understand the whole picture of machine learning with speed.</p>
<p>A purpose common to all machine learning.
It means making a <strong>good model</strong>.</p>
<img width="100%" alt="image02.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/555158/98a68998-8c17-72bd-2858-ea7492db1d34.png">
<p>As you can see in the diagram, this is all about machine learning.
&ldquo;** Give a large amount of data to a computer and find out the rules for making predictions **&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, there are various kinds of data in the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>CSV (Excel): Sales data, customer data</li>
<li>Image: Photos posted on Instagram, video from surveillance cameras</li>
<li>Voice: Conference voice memo, call center call recording</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever the data, machine learning engineers are required to create a good model (precise prediction).
There are various methods available as tool boxes for that purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales data ⇒ Regression (multiple regression, regression tree, etc.)</li>
<li>Instagram photo ⇒ CNN-based method (VGG16, LesNet, etc.)</li>
<li>Voice memo ⇒ Time series analysis (RNN, LSTM, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>When compared to cooking, the common goal of all is to make delicious food**.
For that purpose, it is the same as using the appropriate **recipe (=method)** according to the **material (=data)**.</p>
<h2 id="organizing-terms-related-to-machine-learning">Organizing terms related to machine learning</h2>
<p>Now that you can see the purpose of machine learning, let&rsquo;s broaden our horizons.</p>
<p>As the first struggle in machine learning,
<strong>AI / Machine Learning / Deep Learning</strong>
It is an impression that many people cannot understand these differences.</p>
<p>If you read the 2018 news and articles where AI (machine learning) became popular, regarding these three
I remember that there were many sentences that I felt, &ldquo;I wonder if the person who wrote it doesn&rsquo;t understand much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you do not understand the difference here, even if you study hard
This is an important issue because it is not systematically organized as usable knowledge.</p>
<p>First, the three terms <strong>AI/machine learning/deep learning</strong> have a comprehensive relationship as shown in the figure.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/555158/12de9679-7e64-7c79-5ebd-b47ad902a226.jpeg" alt="image01.jpg"></p>
<p>(Source: <a href="https://www.shikaku-square.com/media/ai-license/001-how-to-study-deep-learning-for-general/">https://www.shikaku-square.com/media/ai-license/001-how-to-study-deep-learning-for-general/</a>)</p>
<p>As you can see, it is a comprehensive relationship of &ldquo;AI&gt; machine learning&gt; deep learning&rdquo;.
The words are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>AI (Artificial Intelligence ):
-A concept born from the first AI boom in the 1950s
-The purpose is to artificially reproduce human intelligence (Intelligence) on a computer.</li>
<li>Machine learning:
-A concrete method considered for realizing AI
-The purpose is to find the law from a large amount of data and predict the future</li>
<li>Deep learning
-Among machine learning, it is a field that uses a technology called ** neural network **
-The purpose is to automate the most important (and time-consuming) AI development process called <strong>feature extraction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By valuing this kind of basic knowledge, you will deepen your understanding of articles and reference books.
Also, when it comes to machine learning projects, it becomes a matter of course for non-programmers to know.</p>
<h2 id="at-the-end">at the end</h2>
<p>Next time, after organizing the <strong>Overview of AI development project</strong>,
<strong>I will write &ldquo;where&rdquo; and &ldquo;how&rdquo;</strong> how machine learning is used.
*(Added on 24/12/2019) &ldquo;<a href="https://qiita.com/Saku731/items/4bbb0798cd55a17e34f0">2nd: Overview of AI development project</a>&rdquo; posted</p>
<p>Those who have studied machine learning may have heard
** For each topic such as &ldquo;preprocessing&rdquo;, &ldquo;learning&rdquo;, &ldquo;tuning&rdquo;, &ldquo;verification&rdquo; **
It will be organized in association with the progress of the AI development project.</p>
<p>In the next article, I&rsquo;ll build on the programming language <strong>Python</strong>
Please look forward to organizing your specific study methods.
*(Postscript) Posted &ldquo;<a href="https://qiita.com/Saku731/items/7f444e1312b85996842f">3: Full disclosure of Python coding procedure</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading for me until the end.</p>
<p>[P.S.]
Since various information is also sent on SNS, please feel free to read the article.
<a href="https://twitter.com/Koji21825331">Twitter account &ldquo;Saku731&rdquo;</a> would be happy to follow you.</p>
<p>~~ Also, at the end of the sentence, we are doing a &ldquo;Team development experience project **&rdquo; for a limited time. ~~
~~ If you are interested, please check the details in <a href="https://forms.gle/5Jf6EaVkKt8eM4S49">[Application Sheet]</a>. ~~
(Addition)
The deadline is due to full capacity.
The next time is scheduled for March 2019, so if you would like information, please fill in <a href="https://forms.gle/62troSMPQv8wLitQ8">[Reservation Form]</a>.</p>
