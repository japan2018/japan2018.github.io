<pre><code>#Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>In recent years, I often hear the word ~~ as a Service such as IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service) in IT area.
Here, I would like to collectively call them <strong>[A-Z]aaS</strong>.
I think that there are increasing opportunities to listen to various [A-Z]aaS such as BaaS (Backend as a Service) such as Firebase and FaaS (Function as a Service) such as AWS Lambda.
This time I searched for various [A-Z]aaS. As a result, we could find <strong>910</strong> [A-Z]aaS. (All the searched results are displayed in the second half.)</p>
<p>How to find #[A-Z]aaS
Let&rsquo;s fix the first two letters and collect what you see in the Google search suggestion.
Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, there are 26*26=676 patterns.
(Caution) Just because it appeared in the Google search suggestion, it does not mean that such a service is actually available.</p>
<p>#5 personally interesting</p>
<p>###ZaaS (Zangyou as a Service)
It is overtime work. It&rsquo;s really Japanese.
(Reference) <a href="https://monobook.org/wiki/ZaaS_(Zangyo_as_a_Service)">https://monobook.org/wiki/ZaaS_(Zangyo_as_a_Service)</a></p>
<p>###FaaS (Failure as a Service)
It seems to be a service that simulates a failure.
(Reference) <a href="https://www.apriorit.com/dev-blog/567-failure-as-a-service">https://www.apriorit.com/dev-blog/567-failure-as-a-service</a>
<a href="https://dev.classmethod.jp/testing/reinvent2018-gremlin/">https://dev.classmethod.jp/testing/reinvent2018-gremlin/</a></p>
<p>###SaaS (Service as a Service)
As the name “service as a service”, is it like an image of introducing a service as if it were a customer?
(Reference) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f88bc87a-0e4b-11e2-8b92-00144feabdc0">https://www.ft.com/content/f88bc87a-0e4b-11e2-8b92-00144feabdc0</a></p>
<p>###CaaS (Crime as a Service)
It&rsquo;s like offering a tool that was created to attack other services as a service. That&rsquo;s dangerous. . .
(Reference) <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/298727">https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/298727</a></p>
<p>###BaaS (Brain as a Service)
Proposed by a company called MicroTask.
It seems that processing is accelerated by CPU + GPU + HPU (Human Processing Unit).
(Reference) <a href="http://www.druckerforum.org/retrospective/fileadmin/user_upload/2013/files/presentations/dayI/otto_chrons_presentation.pdf">http://www.druckerforum.org/retrospective/fileadmin/user_upload/2013/files/presentations/dayI/otto_chrons_presentation.pdf</a></p>
<h1 id="how-to-look">How to look</h1>
<h2 id="study-1-use-google-suggest-api">(Study 1) Use Google Suggest API</h2>
<p>There is Google Suggest API, and you can get the suggestion of Google search when you hit a certain word. (Reference) <a href="https://so-zou.jp/web-app/tech/web-api/google/suggest/">https://so-zou.jp/web-app/tech/web-api/google/suggest/</a>
However, when searching for [A-Z]aaS from a suggestion, you need to type &ldquo;as a Service&rdquo; in the search bar first, and then type the first letter you want to look up, instead of getting the suggestion normally. Therefore, I couldn&rsquo;t understand what URL page to send the request with Google Suggest API. . . If this were possible, I think the amount of work for collection would have been reduced to 1/10.</p>
<h2 id="study-2-use-python-ocr">(Study 2) Use python OCR</h2>
<p>I wanted to avoid hitting the suggested result by hand, so I will use OCR to convert the image information into a character string.
Just hit Aa as a Service to Zz as a Service in the search bar of chrome and take a screen shot of the suggested screen. (676 screenshots taken)</p>
<p>Use the following program to extract character information from an image using OCR.
After that, extract the ones that fit the [A-Z]aaS format.
With the following code, I was able to extract [A-Z]aaS from the image.</p>

これからは何かをしたいと思う時、自分で準備するよりもサービスを利用した方がいいということでしょうか。
