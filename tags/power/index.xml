      <description>#Introduction  I recently read a book &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Control Engineering with Python&amp;rdquo;. I would like to try the Python-Control that appears in it, so I will try to simulate frequency control. It is in the control and title, but the main topic is power engineering.
・Explanation of power system and frequency control ・Try using Python-Control
It will be the content.
#What is frequency The 100V electricity we use at home does not always reach 100V, and it vibrates in a fixed cycle as shown in the figure below.</description>
