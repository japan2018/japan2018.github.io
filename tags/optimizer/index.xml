      <description>2020/1/27 Post  0. Target audience of this article  People who have touched python and have a good execution environment People who have touched pyTorch to some extent People who want to understand optimizer SGD with machine learning by pyTorch People who want to use optimizer SGD of pyTorch for other than Network model (normal variables etc.)  1.First of all Recently, the main focus of research on machine learning is the python language, because python has many libraries (called modules) for high-speed data analysis and calculation.</description>

      <description>Description of trajectory generation, trajectory planning, and how to obtain modern numerical solutions for optimal control problems.  [Additional March 2017] I have released it as a python library as a development system of the contents written here. Please note that the theory implemented below is the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto pseudospectral method, and the content on the current page is different from the Legendre-Gauss pseudospectral method. https://github.com/istellartech/OpenGoddard https://istellartech.github.io/OpenGoddard/
