      <description># Celebration! Django 3.0 released!  02/12/2019 Django 3.0 has been released. Django 1.0 was released in 2008 and 2.0 was released in December 2017. And 3.0 was released on 12/2 of this year. The upgrade from 1 to 2 took about 10 years, but from 2 to 3 it took less than 2 years, which is a surprising sense of speed. On the other hand, what have I been doing over the last two years?</description>
