      <description>#Introduction  I have created a Python module wxparams&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; that collects functions for calculating elements related to weather, such as functions for obtaining dew point temperature from temperature and relative humidity, so I will publish it. (Abbreviation of Weather Parameters)
Before I started Python, I wrote a lot of scripts to process weather data in Perl, and I put together the frequently used functions related to weather in the Perl module.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  This is a sequel to the previous &amp;ldquo;Visualizing the amount of pollen dispersal and the vegetation of Sugi and the effect of wind from open data (pretreatment)&amp;rdquo;. The previous article is from the link below. https://qiita.com/TakuTaku36/items/40cb590b0ae0c6340f8c This time, we will visualize and analyze winds that may be affecting pollen dispersal amounts, sugi vegetation, and prevalence of pollinosis by prefecture at each observation point in Japan.
#Wind visualization There is a little time left from the previous preprocessing of the data before the compilation of this visualization, and during that time it has been slightly improved so that it can be handled easily by merging the data, so it is not exactly the same, but it is not bad.</description>
