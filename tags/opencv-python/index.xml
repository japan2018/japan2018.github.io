      <description>## Introduction  I often use OpenCV feature point extraction and matching, When using multiple images, feature point extraction often took time. Therefore, this time, I made a program that outputs feature point information to a file and uses it for matching.
As an example, let&amp;rsquo;s find the girl with red glasses (target image) from the girls (12 source images) this time!
Source image ⬇︎ Target image ⬇︎ Development environment This time, it was developed in the following environment.</description>

      <description># Outline   Creating an environment   Image generation Image loading Average value of image colors Fiddle with pixels Trimming Resize Addition Affine transformation Flip Grayscale conversion Use Circle drawing function. Color extraction Replace color channel Alpha channel operation * On the way  Creating an environment Yes I have to study image processing properly. .. ! That&amp;rsquo;s openCV! I thought, Having an environment to play with openCV is a challenge.</description>
