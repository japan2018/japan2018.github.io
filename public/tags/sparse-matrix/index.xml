      <description>This article is the 22nd day article of [Furukawa Laboratory Advent Calendar](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/flab).  I am an OB of Furukawa Laboratory, but I was invited by a student to participate. Thank you.
#Introduction This time, I would like to explain the sparse matrix and its representation format while also describing the implementation by scipy.sparse. This article is intended for people who have become accustomed to numpy to some extent, but haven&amp;rsquo;t dealt with sparse matrix-related&amp;hellip; I just want to know a little about what it is!</description>
