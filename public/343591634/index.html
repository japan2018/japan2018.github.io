<pre><code># Target audience and content
</code></pre>
<p>The target audience of this article is those who are going to analyze user behavior and sales data of companies, researchers who have to do a little tedious data analysis to do with Excel, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="background-of-the-demand-for-dick-data-analysts">Background of the demand for &ldquo;dick&rdquo; data analysts</h2>
<p>In recent years, it has become very important for IT companies to analyze data and to make detailed improvements in UI and UX and implement growth hack measures.
Even in research at universities, it is becoming impossible to differentiate from other researchers without making full use of advanced data analysis.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this article, I would like to write about the data analysis ability and study methods that will be required in the future age for those who are new to data analysis/programming who want to do data analysis.</p>
<h1 id="what-are-the-capabilities-required-of-data-analysts">What are the capabilities required of data analysts?</h1>
<ol>
<li>Logical thinking ability to see data correctly</li>
<li>Advanced analysis methods such as statistics and machine learning</li>
<li>Programming ability to shape and aggregate data</li>
<li>Design ability to plan product development and experiments in anticipation of data analysis</li>
</ol>
<p>*Note: Since SQL is troublesome, we will talk about SQL as one programming thing.</p>
<p>To be a top-notch analyst, you need all of the above capabilities,
The most important of the above is the purpose of this article, &ldquo;4. Designing ability to plan product development and experiments in anticipation of data analysis.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="1-logical-thinking-ability-to-see-data-correctly-and-its-study-method">1. Logical thinking ability to see data correctly and its study method</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-the-logical-thinking-ability-to-see-data-correctly">What is the logical thinking ability to see data correctly?</h3>
<p>This is fairly simple.
And the impression is that there are many people who think they are doing it themselves and are not doing it unexpectedly.</p>
<p>For example, when analyzing whether taking action A in the app contributes to the continuation rate,</p>
<ol>
<li>Ratio of “People who took the action A and continued” and “People who did not do it”</li>
<li>Percentage of “People who took action A among those who continued” and “People who did not do it”</li>
<li>Ratio of “People who did not act A and continued” and “People who did not”</li>
</ol>
<p>These meanings are, of course, different, but what indicators are important in your analysis?
What kind of value will these be, what kind of analysis will you take, and what kind of measures will you take next?</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/115709/30644181-e960-c510-8944-6e86486b53cf.jpeg" alt="analysis.jpg"></p>
<p>In the example below,
1 “Ratio of those who continued the action of A” was sufficiently large **
Despite the fact that the proportions of &ldquo;People who took the action of A among those who continued&rdquo; and &ldquo;People who did not take it&rdquo; of 2 were almost the same,
Because the ratio of &ldquo;the number of those who did not take the action of A that continued&rdquo; of 3 is large,
It may be better not to let A act.</p>
<p>It is still simple if there is only one action called A, but if you analyze whether you also performed B action at the same time, it will suddenly become complicated.
Is it possible to understand the situation and think of ways to improve it without confusion?</p>
<h3 id="how-to-acquire-logical-thinking-ability-to-see-data-correctly">How to acquire logical thinking ability to see data correctly</h3>
<p>This can only be learned by looking at various patterns and discussing them with someone.
It&rsquo;s also important to think &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; on my own when I watch the news and various numbers on a regular basis.</p>
<p>a little while ago,
<a href="https://twitter.com/n_4_inspiration/status/1143691099799601152?s=20">&ldquo;Numbers do not lie but liars use numbers&rdquo;</a>
What kind of word was also talked about……</p>
<p>The ability to read the truth from data and logic can be called an essential ability for modern people.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-mathematics-ability-to-use-statistics-and-machine-learning">What is the mathematics ability to use statistics and machine learning?</h3>
<p>How much of these mathematical skills and knowledge you need depends on where you are.</p>
<p>I think it is not necessary if you just do a simple AB test, cohort analysis or funnel analysis.
By making full use of these analysis methods, it is fully possible to consider the following growth hack measures.</p>

<p>However, is it possible to make a sufficient judgment based on the number of data that is currently available?
Is the data taken properly so that a correct decision can be made?
It is necessary to have some statistical knowledge and understanding of numbers just by thinking a little deep questions such as.</p>

It teaches deep insight into consumer behavior with &ldquo;mathematical thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, a deep understanding of things such as AI and deep learning is essential for doing business in the modern age.
Unfortunately, a lot of people take a vague idea of AI, and most of what they say is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Can you imagine what a competitor is doing when they say &ldquo;use AI to get customer data&rdquo;?
Is it possible to say dignifiedly, “We can do that kind of thing” or “We can use data for something more valuable”.</p>
<p>In fact, it doesn&rsquo;t require such a sophisticated mathematical ability to understand AI.
It is fully understandable if you somehow remember high school math.<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ueniki/qin-nagaraxue-berudeep-learning"><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/115709/04921d16-0aff-c36e-d68b-9b86607bd343.jpeg" alt="DeepLearning_Ueno.jpg"></a></p>

<h3 id="studying-advanced-analytical-methods-such-as-statistics-and-machine-learning">Studying advanced analytical methods such as statistics and machine learning</h3>
<p>Again, I have to move my hands to study.
In order to move hands and study statistics and machine learning, I think it would be more efficient to be able to do simple programming.
This is one of the reasons why I think analysts should also learn programming, as I said.
After all, it&rsquo;s easier to understand if you fiddle with the data and experience it.</p>
<p>Again, it may not be necessary if you just want BI tools to do what Excel can do.
(First of all, let&rsquo;s be able to do such obvious things.)</p>
<p>But that can be done by training anyone.
If you want to study a little advanced analysis method that is one step ahead of those analysts, I think it is better to use programming to move hands.</p>

<p>I think the most controversial part is whether analysts should acquire programming skills, and there are people who actually say various things.
(Precisely speaking, SQL is not a programming language, but I ignore the subtleties lol.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Necessary faction
-<a href="https://web-kaizen.co.jp/2018/09/21/sql-query-data-analysis-tableau/amp/">SQL required for data analysis that anyone can understand (Introduction) and Tableau</a></li>
<li>Unnecessary group
-<a href="https://a2i.jp/column/post-23793/">
[Column] Is programming required for data analysis?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both of them are correct and understandable.
(Each article has different assumptions.)</p>
<p>As I mentioned at the beginning, I&rsquo;m a necessity.
As I will explain in detail in Section 4, more precisely, I think that it is necessary for us to be one step ahead of others and to become an analyst who can create truly valuable products and experiments.</p>
<p>There are the following reasons in brief.</p>
<h4 id="bi-tools-are-by-no-means-universal">BI tools are by no means universal</h4>
<p>There are many BI tools that are convenient for the world.
These products are wonderful and very valuable as they promote democratization of data.
If all Japanese companies master BI tools and turn PDCA around, the Japanese economy will grow at an explosive rate.</p>
<p>However, it is currently limited to what you can do without programming or SQL.
Many BI tools require you to write SQL queries for data aggregation and integration.
In fact, even BI tools that claim to be capable of advanced things are actually saying, &ldquo;You can write and execute Python code internally.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://tech.mercari.com/entry/2017/05/19/150728">Merchari&rsquo;s data science team and story of analytics ecosystem</a>
According to this article</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Mercari, there are many people who can write SQL even for non-analyst jobs and do simple analysis by themselves.
Recently, there are rumors that the finance department, accounting department, legal department, and designers are also studying. (It is a fact)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That.
Everyone needs to do their best to study because they need to execute SQL for analysis.</p>
<p>And more importantly,</p>

<p>about it.</p>
<p>Of course, in order to analyze data, we have to collect it.
Hyper-data driven and perfect analysis base is in place.
Startups who do not yet have an analytical foundation, and SME analysts who do not even have the concept of analysis have no choice but to collect data themselves.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s plan the analysis of the data collected by yourself, the smart measure plan, and the check method and the next action after the measure is implemented.
And give the result.
This is the easiest way to show the importance of &ldquo;talking with the data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the role of the analyst is very important in creating the data analysis platform.
There are not necessarily in-house infrastructure engineers or database engineers who are good at data analysis.</p>
<p>Do you really want to collect the data that you really want with a data analysis platform that was created by someone else?
What do you do when you outsource the data analysis platform and you can not do the analysis you really wanted?</p>
<p>And, as I will explain in detail in the next 4, I think that &ldquo;future&rdquo; analysts are required to be able to discuss up to upstream design such as product development and experimental planning with management and engineers.</p>
<p>Humans are no longer needed because simple analyzes are becoming more automated and convenient tools are emerging.</p>

<p>The quickest way to learn is to replace what you are doing in Excel with a programming language such as Python while reading a book like the one above.
Then, look at the book, prepare text data, and play around with free BI tools and SQL.
I would recommend.
(Though it is a programming study method, it requires difficult things for those who have no IT knowledge at all&hellip;</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s actually do the analysis that appears in books like the third with Python and SQL!</p>
<h2 id="4-design-ability-to-plan-product-development-and-experiments-in-anticipation-of-data-analysis">4. Design ability to plan product development and experiments in anticipation of data analysis</h2>
<p>**The really important thing is to do product development and experiment planning in anticipation of data analysis. **</p>
<p>This is the &ldquo;conclusion&rdquo; of this article.</p>
<h3 id="importance-of-product-development-and-experiment-planning-in-anticipation-of-data-analysis">Importance of product development and experiment planning in anticipation of data analysis</h3>
<p>From now on, BI tools will become more and more convenient and there will be almost nothing that cannot be done.
In fact, anyone can do advanced analysis such as machine learning.</p>
<p>Furthermore, basic data analysis will be automated, and tools will find key indicators.</p>
<p>However, what is really &ldquo;important&rdquo; and difficult is what kind of hypothesis should be analyzed in the future, what kind of suggestions should be obtained from that, and what kind of measures should be taken. **Product design and experiment **Think about it during the planning stage.</p>
<p><a href="https://tech.mercari.com/entry/2018/08/22/155059">The reason why we decided to introduce the new dashboard &ldquo;Looker&rdquo; before the product was released</a>
This article describes that Merpey had a data analysis platform in place before the product was released.</p>
<p>In fact, if you do not think about data analysis at the ** product design and experiment planning stage, you may not be able to get the data you want or the analysis results will be unreliable. ..
For example, what kind of log is needed to analyze the desired data? Even if you do an AB test, you need to think about how long, how many people, and how to conduct it.</p>
<p>It will take some more time to be automated up to this point.</p>
<p>That is why, in the modern democratization of data, we believe that it is truly necessary to have an &ldquo;analyzer&rdquo; and a &ldquo;designer&rdquo; who know not only the basic physical strengths of data analysis and business but also data collection and product development. ..</p>

<p>After all, this is also a practice, lol
Although the data analysis infrastructure has gradually been put in place, there are many startups that lack the upper layer data analysts.</p>
<p>Conversely, most of the startups that have achieved results and are about to expand rapidly from now on are &ldquo;one person can shape and collect data, analyze it, develop measures based on the analysis results, and make PDCA plans&rdquo; Analysts Is seeking.</p>
<p>In such a company, I will give a pounding result by myself.
Involve PDCA cycle with various people involved.
If you can become such an analyst, it will give you value wherever you go.</p>
<p>For those who have done simple data analysis such as marketing and growth hacks, it is one way to gain engineering power in the way described in this article.
It would be nice if the person who is currently working as a PM is doing a lot of data analysis.</p>
<p>Become a data analyst, help the data analysis debut of your surroundings, and get a personalized beat at the data! !</p>
