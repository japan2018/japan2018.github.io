<pre><code># Causal reasoning using machine learning
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>A rough understanding and notes of when to use causal reasoning using machine learning methods that have been actively used in recent years (Memorandum)
Basically, the current causal reasoning method is summarized as a flow chart.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Causal reasoning is a series of statistical methods aimed at answering the cause of an outcome. Generally, statistical approaches such as regression analysis focus on quantifying how changes in X are related to changes in Y. On the other hand, statistical causal inference focuses on determining whether a change in X causes a change in Y and quantifying this causal relationship. The field of fusion of machine learning and causal inference, which has been popular in recent years, is used to estimate the causal effect under specific conditions. This time, we roughly arranged the existing causal reasoning methods and machine learning methods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, clarify what you have and why you want to know it, and then analyze it.
Otherwise, you won&rsquo;t see the tactics to take.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="general-causal-reasoning-tactics">General causal reasoning tactics</h2>
<p>There are various policies for causal reasoning. Therefore, various methods can be considered to perform causal reasoning from the data that it has. First, in order to structurally understand causal reasoning, it is divided into two categories. This time, we will identify whether the data we have is experimental data or observation data, and look at typical approaches for each.</p>
<h3 id="policy">Policy</h3>
<ol>
<li>Discrimination between experimental data and observed data</li>
<li>Causal reasoning with experimental data</li>
<li>Causal inference with observed data</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="causal-reasoning-with-experimental-data">Causal reasoning with experimental data</h3>
<p>In the case of experimental data, the estimation is clearer and easier to understand than the observed data, because the experiment is designed to verify the causal effect. In many cases, analysis is performed so as to approximate the RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial) condition. However, in the estimation of the average causal effect during the designed experiment, it is possible to use the classical statistical causal inference method. However, there are times when we want to estimate not only the average causal effect, but also the causal effect under certain circumstances and conditions. Therefore, in recent years, this has been made possible by causal inference that intermixes machine learning methods.</p>
<p>The experimental data will be divided into four categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Covariate difference between intervention and non-intervention</li>
<li>Part of the intervention group is non-intervention</li>
<li>Different effects among subgroups in intervention group</li>
<li>Structural understanding of causal relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>If the data you have is determined to be experimental data, consider from the top down. Then perform the desired analysis.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="covariate-difference-between-intervention-and-non-intervention">Covariate difference between intervention and non-intervention</h4>
<p>This is a general causal reasoning. Basically, it is assumed that the causal effect between the intervention group and the non-intervention group is to be estimated. At that time, covariates other than treatment (cause) and response (result) will differ between groups. Then, it becomes impossible to estimate the correct effect. Therefore, the covariates are adjusted to be as equal as possible among the groups, and then the estimation is performed. Major policies include DID, matching, IPW, etc.</p>
<p>→ DID, matching, IPW etc.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="part-of-the-intervention-group-is-non-intervention">Part of the intervention group is non-intervention</h4>
<p>Because of the unbiased estimation of intervention effects in experimental studies, random allocation of interventions does not mean that they will be performed as they are (non-compliance). If the assignment of the intervention is equal to the intervention actually received, then the individual has adhered to the assigned intervention. On the other hand, when they are not equal, it becomes non-compliant. In other words, under non-compliance conditions, different intervention groups exist in the compliance group and the non-compliance group. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate the average causal effect limited to the compliance group (LATE).</p>
<p>→ manipulated variable (IV)</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="different-effect-among-subgroups-in-intervention-group">Different effect among subgroups in intervention group</h4>
<p>Within the intervention group, different covariates were taken for each sample. Then, when obtaining the intervention effect for each specific sample, it is necessary to calculate the intervention effect personalized under the specific condition in the intervention group. Causal reasoning using so-called machine learning.</p>
<p>→ HTE (Heterogeneous Treatment Effects), Uplift Modeling
→ GRF (Generalized Random Forest) and ORF (Orthogonal Random Forest) estimate the intervention effect without calculating the propensity score
→ Meta-Learner estimates the intervention effect from the estimated value using the propensity score after modeling &amp; effect estimation for each group</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="structural-understanding-of-causal-relationships">Structural understanding of causal relationships</h4>
<p>When one variable affects another variable, it may act directly or indirectly through a parameter. At this time, it is important to analyze how direct and how indirect the effects that affect variables are. By understanding not only the relationship between the cause and effect, but also the mechanism that caused the result, it becomes possible to analyze which parametric variable should be changed to achieve a high effect.</p>
<p>→ Mediation analysis</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="causal-reasoning-with-observation-data">Causal reasoning with observation data</h3>
<p>In the case of observation data, many are observed regularly. At that time, it will be used as time-series data. On the other hand, if it is not time-series data, variables other than the variables that cause and result are defined. At this time, sufficient knowledge about the specific situation is required. It is necessary to determine the causal structure based on this.</p>
<p>The observation data is divided into the following cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rQnQ6F4.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="heterogeneous-treatment-effects-hte">Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE)</h2>
<p>Individuals differ not only in their background characteristics, but also in their response to a particular treatment, intervention, or stimulus. In particular, the therapeutic effect may systematically change depending on the treatment tendency (Xie et al., 2012). And in the presence of this effect heterogeneity, the estimation of Average Treatment Effect (ATE), which is a classical causal inference approach using the main effects, was not always sufficient. Therefore, by considering Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) as an estimation of the intervention effect that takes into account the influence at the personal level such as the background, it is possible to make an estimation that takes into account each of these effects. At that time, causal reasoning is executed using machine learning.</p>
