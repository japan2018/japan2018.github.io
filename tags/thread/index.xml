      <description>Recently I had the opportunity to write an orchestration layer (BFF) application in Python.  Although asyncio was introduced from Python 3.4, I/O bound processing can be handled efficiently even with a single thread, but since GIL still exists for CPU bound processing, parallel processing is possible under a single process. It is limited.
From this, it can be seen as a language characteristic that it is more suitable for handling multiple I/O bound processes than CPU bound processes.</description>
