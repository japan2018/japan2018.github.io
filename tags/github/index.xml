      <description># Article summary  I wanted to put the sales involved in the development with GitHub Flow, that is, the development with a simple pull operation, and created such an environment. At that time, I made and released a web application that supplements some missing functions, so I will write various stories about it.

      <description>I bought the Pixel 4 and received the Google Nest Hub. It seems to be usable as a digital photo frame. Since I&#39;m sorry, I will display the grass image on GitHub.  Google Nest Hub settings Immediately after purchase, Nest Hub will display an art gallery prepared by Google. Change this to a setting that allows you to view your favorite image.
 Launch the Google Home app on your iOS or Android device   If you bought Nest Hub, you should have installed it  Go to Nest Hub&amp;gt; Photo Frame   Change the display image setting to Google Photos  Change &amp;ldquo;Personal Photo Organize&amp;rdquo; setting to &amp;ldquo;Real-time shared albums only&amp;rdquo;   Without this setting, GitHub grass images, etc.</description>
