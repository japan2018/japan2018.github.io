      <description>The length with the direction can be expressed by a vector. Clifford algebra makes it possible to handle areas and volumes by combining vectors. We introduce a Pauli matrix as a three-dimensional Clifford algebra representation matrix and confirm that it is isomorphic to a biquaternion. The calculation by SymPy is attached.  This is a series article.
