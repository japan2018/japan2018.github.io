If so, it will be an article that hopeless for university students who are not information systems, so I will clarify my features first. I am in the second year of university, belonging to the Department of Physics, Faculty of Science. I&amp;rsquo;m in the manufacturing circle, so programming (Python) is a bit of a bit of skill, but I&amp;rsquo;m just a beginner in deep learning**.</description>
