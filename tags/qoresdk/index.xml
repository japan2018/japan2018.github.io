      <description>## tl;dr   I made a muscle training estimation app Qore uses an algorithm called reservoir computing Performed a task of classifying time series data from acceleration data that can be acquired with a smartphone -Code Pretty good -99.6% accuracy with test data This should make you a muscle engineer  Strategy  Collect accelerometer data with a smartphone (iphone) Time series data with three components on the x, y and z axes is available Learn with 4 types of muscle training: push-ups, abs, squats, abs You can tell what kind of muscle training you did with only your smartphone  Data collection   Do your muscle workout with your smartphone in your pants pocket -This time, in any muscle training, put the smartphone in the pocket in the same direction -It seems that it will be more difficult to estimate if it is set in a different direction</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Hi everyone, this is kon2 :sunny::sunny: I am a student who usually studies negative electrode materials for lithium batteries at university.
Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in everyday life such as mobile phones and electric vehicles. Since you recently won the Nobel Prize, you often hear the name.
Although lithium-ion batteries have been in commercial use for more than 40 years, they are still an active research field, and the use of machine learning has recently been drawing attention.</description>
