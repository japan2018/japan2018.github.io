#What to do this time Last time, we did everything from drawing models using test textures to implementing the player&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint.
 Improved player movement Examination of collision judgment  Improved player movement Don&amp;rsquo;t you think the movement of the player you implemented last time is unnatural?</description>

##Trigger My first exposure to programming came from “Minecraft”.
That was over 4 years ago. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in so-called remodeling contents called &amp;ldquo;MOD&amp;rdquo; in Minecraft, and entered the world of programming, &amp;ldquo;I want to make it myself!</description>

      <description>Hello Sugo of Quemix.  Here is an overview of the projects currently underway at IPA&amp;rsquo;s unexplored business. By making a game that includes the properties of quantum, we are going to make two games within the period. This time, we will introduce the first game.
#Notes If you try to explain everything such as the history of the game, the details of the rules, the explanation of quantum, etc. so that it can be understood by those who are new to the game, the amount will be too large, so it is a rather broken introduction Please note.</description>
