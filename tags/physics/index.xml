      <description>#Introduction  Transparent gas is invisible to the naked eye. Still, there are times when I want to see. Fluid visualization technologies such as the schlieren method and shadowgraph method are useful in this regard. This time I will try to visualize this fluid at home. Basically, you only have to prepare the camera.
References I experimented with this as a reference. We recommend reading this page for detailed theory. Improvement of visualization method of density gradient based on BOS method</description>

      <description>Itâ€™s!  Hello. This is my second post. This time I tried to simulate X-ray diffraction with Python. The full code (I use Jupyter Notebook) is GitHub1
#X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) X-ray diffraction is a phenomenon in which X-rays are diffracted in a crystal. X-rays are electromagnetic waves with wavelengths within a certain range (about 1 nm to 1 pm), and diffraction is the propagation of something that has the properties of waves around obstacles.</description>
