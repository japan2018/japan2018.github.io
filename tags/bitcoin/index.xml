      <description>#1. About this article  ##1-1. Introduction This article was touched by me as a high school student when I received [Udemy: An Introduction to Blockchain Development from Scratch Beginning with Python Taught by Active Silicon Valley Engineers](https://www.udemy.com/share/1021OSAkIbdVdQQXo=/) , I wrote this article with the hope that everyone reading this article should attend. I completed this lesson in 2 days, so if you are already accustomed to development, I think it is sufficiently possible to understand and implement in 1 day.</description>

      <description>This article is day 6 of [Blockchain Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/blockchain).Yesterdaywas@y-chan&#39;s[Understandingatomicswap](https://qiita.com/y-chan/items/f69b628f65ce12097e4a).   Occurrence of things &amp;ldquo;There are a lot of blockchain commentary books out there, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how it will end up.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Structural blockchain seems easy, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand how to make the contents of the block or the mechanism of mining.&amp;rdquo;
I thought &amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t understand the explanation, it&amp;rsquo;s a programmer who should implement it by Mumu.</description>

      <description>#Background    If you were surfing the internet, you found a very helpful site about Systre -Even in the literature! How to start Bitcoin BOT automatic trading -It was explained very clearly -I feel like I can do it even if I have no experience with Systre
  Because I was interested, I decided to write the code on the weekend and check the feeling -GithubThisisthecodeIwrotethistime.(notebookformat)
  By the way, I tried Cryptocurrency prediction with LSTM and it didn&amp;rsquo;t work very well.</description>
