<p>I&rsquo;m always indebted to you, but I&rsquo;m sorry for not posting.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As is said to be the &ldquo;cliff of 2025,&rdquo; digital transformation is an urgent issue for the manufacturing industry. While emerging countries are chasing after quality and cost, I feel the harshness of Japan at the factory.
I wonder, &ldquo;Is Japanese quality really good?&rdquo; (Maybe it&rsquo;s just my factory!).
However, for Japan, whose population is declining, it is clear that it is necessary to manufacture high value-added products, and AI/IoT in particular is a major touchstone for that. I would like to convey the feeling of the site from the person who is in charge of AI/IoT at the manufacturer (smiley w).</p>
<p>I would like to say the following three points.
・It is useless to create an AI/IoT promotion section only for the headquarters mechanism
・Shopping alone is not enough, it is necessary to raise the overall programming level
・Existing IT personnel may become an obstacle</p>
<h3 id="it-is-useless-to-create-an-aiiot-promotion-section-only-for-the-headquarters-mechanism">It is useless to create an AI/IoT promotion section only for the headquarters mechanism</h3>
<p>What many large companies do is to set up an AI/IoT specialized department in a headquarters structure that is separate from the factory. I think this is a pattern that will not work if it is made only for the headquarters. I think that what is important for utilizing AI is high quality data and software customized on site. In that respect, I think it is extremely difficult for a person at the headquarters to obtain new data without knowing the existing data of the factory. In addition, even if they start collecting new data, they can&rsquo;t deal with the troubles that occur every day and leave it to the factory.
Headquarters &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t analyze because good data doesn&rsquo;t come up&rdquo;
Factory &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think how difficult it is to get data!&rdquo;
Is likely to be. After all, it&rsquo;s not enough to set up a promotion group only at the headquarters, so it&rsquo;s no use unless there is a main team in charge at the factory. I think setting up a group at the headquarters is good for itself, but I think it would be impossible for the headquarters alone to succeed.</p>
<h3 id="shopping-alone-is-not-enough-needs-to-raise-overall-programming-level">Shopping alone is not enough, needs to raise overall programming level</h3>
<p>I think there are many things that tend to be done after shopping. Hey Tableau, Hey DataRobot, and other high-priced products such as DataSpider and SensorCorpus that make us happy with AI/IoT. I think this is really wasteful in the sense that I cannot master it. Customization is required to utilize it in daily manufacturing, and you must write the code yourself somewhere. I think it is possible to buy a tool or drop one hand without understanding this necessity.</p>
<h3 id="existing-it-personnel-may-be-a-barrier">Existing IT personnel may be a barrier</h3>
<p>I want this to be the best of the three. It&rsquo;s been nearly 30 years since a factory built in the bubble era. At our factories, that&rsquo;s about it, but what&rsquo;s common in these factories is the legacyization of systems. For example, my factory uses Oracle, but I get angry when I connect to the database with SQL.
Existing IT staff &ldquo;What should I do if the connection becomes unstable?&rdquo;
&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;
I want to get angry by connecting to Oracle with a command and issuing a select statement with SQL (click and click on GUI software from 30 years ago to get the data). .. AI development would be difficult in this situation. Even if only I issue a select statement after the end of a frustration, if there is anything, all new code will be scapegoat, so it is a day-to-day affair.
I am sorry to write a bat file that connects to Oracle, but it is not true. .. You&rsquo;re doing bad things! ? In addition, the bad point is that the knowledge of the existing personnel is one generation ago. Even if you have a problem and explain
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Python!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="countermeasure">Countermeasure</h2>
<p>Based on the above, the measures I need to take in order to utilize AI/IoT in the manufacturing industry are described below.</p>
<h4 id="it-is-useless-to-create-an-aiiot-promotion-section-only-at-the-headquarters">It is useless to create an AI/IoT promotion section only at the headquarters</h4>
<p>→ I am very helpful to the headquarters. But I think that the factory side also needs a team.</p>
<ol>
<li>In charge of infrastructure that ensures data quality,</li>
<li>In charge of the backend that manages the database and API,</li>
<li>And in charge of the front-end that customizes according to the work of production technology<br>
Is required. It may be okay to let the headquarters develop common algorithm development, but I think that a main team is needed in the factory.</li>
</ol>
<h6 id="existing-it-personnel-may-get-in-the-way">Existing IT personnel may get in the way</h6>
<p>→ It&rsquo;s tough. It&rsquo;s easy to say clearly. To avoid trouble, it would be ideal if the data line, database, and server were completely separated for AI/IoT. The database can be MySQL, the server can be GCP or AWS, and a PC can manage it. The data line can be divided by Second Ether. Still, when I was told that other software stopped due to heavy data traffic, I laugh and cry in my heart.</p>
<h6 id="the-bottom-of-the-whole-needs-to-be-raised">The bottom of the whole needs to be raised</h6>
<p>Everyone needs to understand programming. It&rsquo;s hard to get rooted among people who think they are irrelevant, but I think the staff needs some understanding. I think it&rsquo;s good to have students study under the name of &ldquo;tools that automate fixed procedures&rdquo;.</p>
<p>###Finally
It would be wonderful if I could master AI/IoT, but I think there are many manufacturing issues in Japan. It&rsquo;s old with something attached, and it&rsquo;s stuck. .. It would be easy to recreate from the factory! What? Ah, the emerging countries have already won. &hellip;No! !</p>
<p>I am developing an application with Angular. It is a business application that obtains text information from photos and quotes it for use in blogs, etc. at super-fast speed.
