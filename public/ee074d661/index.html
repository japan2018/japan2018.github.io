<pre><code>#What is the difference between statistics and machine learning? Why can't I predict from machine learning today and make money?
</code></pre>
<p>Perhaps everyone wonders when they start studying machine learning. And why can&rsquo;t many business companies use it for their daily work today? The question also comes up. There are various documents, but I was having trouble comprehending them, so I rearranged them myself. I&rsquo;m putting together a lot of information by combining information.
This article explains why many companies cannot use machine learning approaches to drive business starting today&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="first-of-all-i-tried-to-summarize-the-way-of-thinking-and-differences-between-statistics-and-machine-learning-in-the-table">First of all, I tried to summarize the way of thinking and differences between statistics and machine learning in the table</h1>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/518389/56d3b2c0-4a3d-7ced-05fa-c974102ed460.png" alt="Statistics or Machine Learning Ver2.png"></p>
<p>Although many refer to it, even though they are related to each other, they have different end goals. **While &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo; makes predictions and decisions, it is generally a black box as to why it happened. For the predictions and judgments made in &ldquo;statistics&rdquo;, it is important to reason why such a conclusion was reached (a science for making reason), and the reason is a white box. **</p>
<p>#Why do many businesses “cannot use the machine learning approach”?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Statistics&rdquo;, which aims at focusing on factors, is suitable for solving social science problems, and &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo; is suitable for predicting natural sciences and automatically processing by robots. **And, from the result of the arrangement, I came to think and the reality is. If there is a theme that you can identify the factors that fluctuate in sales and think of measures to increase sales for the factors, this is the story of &ldquo;statistics&rdquo; (social science problem solving) that organizes the degree of impact, &ldquo;machine learning And that&rsquo;s not what happens. (In addition, although there is an impact analysis function provided as an AI function of BI, this requires the designation of the items that may have an impact, and the related calculations are based on “statistics”. It&rsquo;s an area. In many cases, the recommended product display on the EC site only displays combinations that other people have bought, and it should be closer to a simple query such as machine learning prediction.) On the other hand, robot processing such as typhoon track prediction, earthquake prediction (I think it is still impossible), image recognition and voice recognition is a machine learning approach. For example, the path/intensity prediction of a typhoon may be affected by temperature, seawater temperature, jet stream, etc., as long as the path/intensity is correct. The temperature and sea temperature are interrelated by multicollinearity and multicollinearity, so it is preferable not to use both at the same time in the sense of a statistical model.) If the result is correct, it is irrelevant to the people and has no interest.
*<em>Many business companies are interested in “social science” in areas such as sales, marketing, finance, and human resources, and are often not interested in “natural science” or “robot”.
(<em>Because marketing automation considers automation, it may be said that this area is a robot. Although it is limited.)</em></em></p>
<h1 id="and-why-are-so-many-companies-neither-statistics-nor-machine-learning">And why are so many companies &ldquo;neither statistics nor machine learning?&rdquo;</h1>
<p>● **There is no data. **This is all.
Most business companies don&rsquo;t have a clean dataset like the Kaggle competition.
**(1) There is no attribute information data that should be the main factor. **
For example, there is no past, latest, or future attribute information of customers who purchase goods or services. The attribute information is fluctuating and the past attribute is the past attribute, and the current attribute is the current attribute. For example, it is relatively easy to automate credit for obtaining the latest information on customer information as an example of a credit card company, but it is difficult to predict what will happen in 10 years. Although the circumstances such as educational background, family structure, and annual income change, the latest attribute information is not always managed correctly. As a result, who is using the credit card (who is the attribute? Credit cards companies (even companies that have a large amount of personal information with many attributes) are largely unknown. I always have the latest information that does not change once I get it, such as gender and age, but it is too limited considering the customer attributes. It is impossible to try to connect past, present, and future consumption trends in such a state.</p>
<p>**(2) Transaction data and master data are not linked. **
Master data (such as part number) changes, and past, present, and future are not connected.</p>
<p>**(3) Even internal information cannot comprehensively convert (all) strategies and measures into data for statistics and machine learning. **
It is Atalimae&rsquo;s story that influences purchasing and sales depending on corporate strategy and measures (such as advertising and campaigns), but it is almost impossible to pass data for statistics and machine learning. It is impossible to talk about the whole company, although individual analysis can be done to determine whether or not the measures have been successful with pinpoint accuracy. But the manager wants it.</p>
<p>#Conclusion
●People who are not interested in natural sciences or robot processing/automation of processing, companies do not seem to have a great merit of getting into “machine learning” (unless each of them makes use of crushing).
● If there is no appropriate data to be used for analysis, it is meaningless and useless effort to flag both &ldquo;statistics&rdquo; and &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo;.
● If the prerequisite analysis data has not been prepared, it is necessary to enter from the data acquisition/preparation.
● The future of data scientists who do not understand the roots and essence is at risk! Results without results&hellip;</p>
