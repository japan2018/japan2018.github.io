      <description>#Introduction  In recent years, I often hear the word ~~ as a Service such as IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service) in IT area. Here, I would like to collectively call them [A-Z]aaS. I think that there are increasing opportunities to listen to various [A-Z]aaS such as BaaS (Backend as a Service) such as Firebase and FaaS (Function as a Service) such as AWS Lambda.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Here, I will try extracting characters from the subtitles that are displayed under the political broadcast. Since there is no background, it seems to be quite binary.
Although it is possible to get the character and the position with considerable accuracy by extracting the character with the google cloud vision API, I will try to get the character by other methods here.
tesseract-ocr / pyocr First, let&amp;rsquo;s recognize characters using tesseract and pyocr.</description>
