<pre><code>&lt;b&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>First of all, the target audience for this article is &ldquo;non-engineers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As a non-engineer, I am aiming to acquire programming skills and explain what I did in the process.</p>
<p>By the way, I am not studying as a programmer now, and I am still studying, and since I was writing an article in the course of studying in the first place, the teacher who was suddenly made an adviser of the Kabaddi club decided the rules of the sport. I think it would be similar to teaching kabaddi to members in parallel with learning.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s all right, I hope that you read the article and get a feeling like, &ldquo;Oh, I was dissatisfied with what other people were feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>First time, “I want to make a BOT that skips the contents of Google Calendar to LINE”</h2>
<p>I sometimes work as a freelance photographer, but I often get inquiries from clients asking, &ldquo;When is a vacant schedule?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am happy that I can prepare some candidate days, but I answered &ldquo;This time this day and this day this time is free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, it became difficult at last&hellip;
That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m in the culture of the company I work for.<b>“My schedule is on the Google calendar, including travel time, whether it&rsquo;s public or private,”</b></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strange company, isn&rsquo;t it? But thanks to that, I can talk smoothly about scheduling meetings. Just look at everyone&rsquo;s Google Calendar and skip the schedule when it&rsquo;s available.</p>
<p>By the way, I wanted to make the most of this culture in my free work as a starting point for the title!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should I just share with Google Calendar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it okay to send a Google calendar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You might think, but that&rsquo;s not good enough.</p>
<p>Because when you ask, &ldquo;Please tell me your schedule!&rdquo; How is it?
After all, the outline of supply and demand is too clear. (Meaningless)</p>
<p>With LINE Bot, I think it would be nice to have a rough listening style like &ldquo;This Week&rsquo;s Schedule&rdquo;. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.</p>
<p>So what I asked for
<b>A person who is likely to be a client is asked to register &ldquo;Bots that say my schedule&rdquo; as a friend on LINE, and when work is about to occur, ask the bot for the schedule.</b>
Was to establish a series of processes.</p>
<p>I took a class about API at a programming school called Proto Out Studio (<a href="https://protoout.studio/),">https://protoout.studio/),</a> which I am attending, so I wondered if I could do it well.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>What I did</b></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Purchased a paid article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did what I said, but it didn&rsquo;t work and I asked a programmer at work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tried to ask a question on teratail without moving after all</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I was told to learn from the basics with 4.teratail, I bought a book and read a little</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>However, I could not proceed with paid articles, so I made a program based on free articles that seemed to be easy in the end</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was a little nice to see it move. ← Imakoko</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>1. I purchased a paid article. </b>
I will not paste the URL, but the article published in note was &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be able to check appointments in Google Calendar and add appointments using LINE Bot&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is it! What I wanted!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a fee, but I bought it fairly easily and immediately started moving my hands.
However, my &ldquo;source code copying technique&rdquo;, which does not hold the basics, soon reached its limit.</p>
<p>By the way, the method I tried to understand the code somehow without understanding the basics has similar results (in this case, operating Google Calendar with LINE Bot), looking for the source code of other articles, I tried to find similarities to the main code and replace the commented-out content of other articles with the main code.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t understand the meaning?</p>
<p>In short, it&rsquo;s similar to &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t understand Chinese, you can guess the content of Chinese from there, if you realize that there are some Japanese kanji.&rdquo;</p>
<p>result&hellip;
<b>2. I did it according to the article, but it didn&rsquo;t work, so I asked a programmer at work.</b></p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t move it. I didn&rsquo;t understand the meaning.
So, when I caught and asked a programmer in a very busy workplace, it taught me what was stumbled, albeit partially.
I really wanted to hear more, but he left somewhere.</p>
<p>And the contents that were partially taught are different from the contents of the article, and in order to proceed with the contents of the article, I found that if I wrote the code according to the article and did not proceed further, it would eventually not work, so it is finally All the measures have run out. I&rsquo;ve been using it for about 6 hours. (Does not matter)</p>
<p><b>3. After all, I asked a question on teratail without moving </b></p>
<p>I found that there is a service such as &ldquo;Yahoo wisdom bag for programmers&rdquo; called teratail, and I posted it with low hope.
I&rsquo;m glad I got a response in about 30 minutes after posting.</p>
<p>Actual post

<a href="https://teratail.com/questions/248595?modal=q-comp">https://teratail.com/questions/248595?modal=q-comp</a></p>
<p>I think you could tell me the degree of my beginners by exchanging questions.</p>
<p>By the way, although he kindly responded to me, my immaturity that I could not carry out the contents you taught me was revealed, and I immediately recommended basic learning.</p>
<p><b>I was told to learn from the basics with 4.teratail, I bought a book and read it a bit</b></p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/603301/7c7ffac9-1d97-3084-ce1e-ddb0de5df971.jpeg" alt="download.jpg">
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4295002089/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_5RWEEbE1TKTNM">https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4295002089/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_5RWEEbE1TKTNM</a></p>
<p>I bought and read it. First half only. The contents were easy to understand.
(You might think why you bought a Python book, but what I was having trouble with the paid article was the description of Python.)</p>
<p>Somehow I thought, &ldquo;Is there a place where I don&rsquo;t have enough paid articles or code?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because, in the process so far, it&rsquo;s no longer &ldquo;not totally understandable&rdquo;. The meaning of the description was somehow understood, and I noticed that the specification of the function necessary for execution was not written in the article. (I&rsquo;m listening to what I know, I don&rsquo;t understand)</p>
<p>Well, in that situation, I&rsquo;m finally getting tired.</p>
<p><b>5. However, I could not proceed with paid articles, so I made a program based on free articles that seemed to be easy in the end</b></p>
<p>The cause was being understood, but I was spending too much time so far, and my body and mind were exhausted.</p>
<p>I thought &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t move my hands because I&rsquo;m too busy as it is,&rdquo; so I&rsquo;d like to use a program that &ldquo;cuts off the Google Calendar schedule to LINE Bot&rdquo; by cutting the features I wanted to do. , I set out on another trip looking for articles.</p>
<p>And I found a nice article. ↓
<a href="https://qiita.com/imajoriri/items/e211547438967827661f">https://qiita.com/imajoriri/items/e211547438967827661f</a></p>
<p>All I had to do was touch GAS (Google Apps Script) and LINE Notify, so I managed to move it. (It&rsquo;s a copy, though)</p>
<p><b>6. It was a little nice to see it move. ← Imacoco</b></p>
<p>I found that I was very happy when the program worked. Even with copy and paste.</p>
<p>There was certainly a feeling that &ldquo;he listened to me&rdquo; and it was a habit.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Forced talk</b></p>
<p>This time I have never been able to achieve it technically, but rather than being exhausted by doing what I want to do, I think that a small success experience will eventually lead to a constitution that can tackle issues for a long time. I noticed that.</p>
<p>I also thought that it would be inefficient to make something without being able to ask more people.</p>
<p>As a way of thinking &ldquo;a person who can&rsquo;t ask people&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m that type), I often don&rsquo;t have a clear idea of what I want to do. (I)</p>
<p>Since I ask people only the means without knowing what I want to do, the person being asked will be troubled by the appropriate answer and will be suspicious. I think there is a thing. (I)</p>
<p>The person who asks the question is actually raising their own hurdles and not knowing what kind of means they have, but they ask about the means. I think that I am unconsciously doing such a way to tighten my neck. (I)</p>
<p>Based on my own experience, when I talked to people, the only communication I would focus on was &ldquo;I want to say this&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Actually, I would like to communicate while thinking about the other person a little more, but it is a situation where I can not reach that much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re annoying everyone around you.
I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;</p>
<p>Therefore, it was a non-engineer article.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this far.</p>
