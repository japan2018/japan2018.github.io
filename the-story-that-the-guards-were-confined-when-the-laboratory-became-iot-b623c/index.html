<pre><code>This article is the 20th day of Retty Advent Calendar 2019.
</code></pre>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Hirano&rsquo;s “<a href="https://engineer.retty.me/entry/2019/12/19/190000">Retty Data Analysis Team-Review of the 2nd year after launch ~Data platform/data democratization/statistical model~</a>”.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you. My name is Koda and I&rsquo;m currently an intern at Retty as a 20-year-old engineer.</p>
<p>For the time being, I was wondering what to write after registering for participation, but I made my own entry/exit management system (electronic lock) that is used in the laboratory of the university I am attending, so I will talk about it.</p>
<h1 id="supplement">Supplement</h1>
<p>We received a lot of opinions on Hatena Bookmark. Thank you very much.
As some people pointed out, the reaction on Slack when the problem &ldquo;I could not get out of the room at night&rdquo; occurred was inappropriate, so I deleted it.
I regret that it was not appropriate to take up such content on a blog.
In addition, since we have not taken any measures to deal with an unexpected situation such as an earthquake or fire, we would like to consider a mechanism that can be unlocked in an emergency.</p>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>Immediately after being assigned to the laboratory, I was told what to do with the room key. It&rsquo;s a sequel.</p>
<p>If you need to create duplicate keys for each person, it will be expensive, and managing keys for each person will be troublesome.
When the total number of third-year students is about 20, some people will be lost.</p>
<p>Next, I thought about introducing a smart lock like the Qrio, but the door in our laboratory was not compatible with the thumb turn &ldquo;type with door knob&rdquo;.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/193357/b3c0c403-2612-a0ac-a5fa-e184918f8386.png" alt="qrio">
(Other supported thumb turns are detailed in <a href="https://qrio.me/support/smartlock/purchase/">this page</a>.)</p>
<p>As far as I know, there is no smart lock product for this type, so the door IoT hurdle will be considerably increased.</p>
<p>I had no choice but to make it myself, so I decided to make it. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
It&rsquo;s a sequel.</p>
<h1 id="overall-composition">Overall composition</h1>
<p>The final composition is like this.
I made it as I like it with the technology I want to use.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/193357/835438de-9ad1-626a-752a-3a29f502eeb8.png" alt="slide1"></p>
<h2 id="electronic-lock">Electronic lock</h2>
<p>The electronic lock itself is a <code>RaspberryPi3 Model B+</code> with a servo motor, reed switch and card reader connected. The program that controls the servo motor was written in Python.
Two card readers are used, and they are attached to the inside and outside of the door to control the status of <code>inside</code> or <code>outside</code>. I will explain why I manage it later.</p>
<p>In order to have <strong>auto lock</strong>, the reed switch is attached and the opening/closing status of the door is acquired.</p>
<h2 id="card-key">Card key</h2>
<p>We registered student IDs and ICOCA&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.orangetags.jp/words/idm"><code>idm</code></a> in the database and authenticate them using them as keys.
Although it has not been supported yet, you can unlock the card registered with ApplePay etc. if you support it.</p>
<p>As a side benefit, there is also &ldquo;<strong>Reducing the risk of lost keys</strong>&rdquo;.
This is because if you delete the target data from the database, you will not be able to enter or exit with that card.</p>
<h2 id="the-one-to-detect">The one to detect</h2>
<p>It was often used when the Amazon Dash Button hack was popular <a href="https://github.com/maddox/dasher"><code>maddox/dasher</code></a>,butwhenIlookedintotherepositoryafteralongtime<a href="https://github.com/Nekmo/amazon-dash"><code>Nekmo/amazon-dash</code></a> came out.</p>
<p>All settings can be described in <code>yaml</code> format, and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/nekmo/amazon-dash/">Docker image</a> is also provided.</p>
<h2 id="room-management">Room management</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;in-room display board (whiteboard)**&rdquo; that is familiar in university laboratories, but it seemed to be good with an electronic lock, so I made it good.</p>
<p>This is explained in the next function introduction.</p>
<h1 id="function-introduction">Function introduction</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to introduce it because it has some functions, not just an &ldquo;electronic lock&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="web-management-screen">Web management screen</h2>
<p>I made a simple management screen with <code>Flask</code> to register/edit/delete members.
The front is everyone&rsquo;s favorite <code>Bootstrap + jQuery</code>.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/193357/ba9d843e-f7e5-35b2-a857-b604e4adbb4c.png" width=80%></p>
<p>By the way, you have to look up <code>idm</code> yourself and enter it manually.
If you use <code>WebUSB</code>, you can connect a Felica reader, read it from there, and register it, but it has not been implemented yet.</p>
<h2 id="dashboard-function">Dashboard function</h2>
<p>We have made it possible to see the room status online so that you can see who is from anywhere.
A monitor is installed at the entrance with a monitor arm, and another RaspberryPi is used to create and display a kiosk terminal.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/193357/3d868a1b-96ba-c19c-eb34-ff46116ea3c7.jpeg" width=80%>
It&rsquo;s convenient because you don&rsquo;t have to move the magnet on the whiteboard.</p>
<h2 id="slack-integration-function">Slack integration function</h2>
<p>When you press the button on the door, this message will be sent to Slack&rsquo;s notification channel.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/193357/f2b4deeb-56fc-da54-2d10-9e2336775f84.png" alt="notification1">
By linking with Slack&rsquo;s <a href="https://api.slack.com/interactive-messages">InteractiveComponents</a>, you can unlock by pressing &ldquo;lock unlock&rdquo; without having to go to the entrance. I will.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/193357/5fc821f3-5fba-f648-ddb7-42c88be8888b.png" alt="notification2">
By the way, in this case, from your own seat, yell in a loud voice, &ldquo;Let me open the key!&rdquo;, and open the door yourself to get in.</p>
<p>You can leave the house by pressing &ldquo;Ignore&rdquo;.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/193357/e3be4ab2-b2bc-8578-c9d3-79899b84174e.png" alt="notification3"></p>
<p>As you can see in the image, there is also a log of &ldquo;who responded&rdquo;.
It&rsquo;s also nice to have Slack&rsquo;s notification badge disappear when someone responds because the message is overwritten.</p>
<h1 id="where-i-devised">Where I devised</h1>
<p>The device that connects the unlock button of Slack and the RaspberryPi has been devised a little.
Specifically, when the Slack button is pressed, Slack sends a <code>POST</code> request to the endpoint specified here, but where is this endpoint?</p>
<p>It seems quick to set the endpoint directly on the RaspberryPi, but I did not want to expose the electronic lock to the Internet, so I decided to put <code>MQTT</code> between them.
For MQTT and MQTT broker, <a href="https://gist.github.com/voluntas/89000a06a7b79f1230ab">[First MQTT]</a> was easy to understand, so I will post it here.</p>
<p>![Screenshot 2019-12-16 14.56.02.png](<a href="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/193357/14d920ff-c937-f507-30fb-(559e4915b7e2.png)">https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/193357/14d920ff-c937-f507-30fb-(559e4915b7e2.png)</a>
First, set up an API for receiving requests from Slack, and if you receive a request that the &ldquo;unlock button has been pressed,&rdquo; make a <code>publish</code> to the target <code>topic</code>.
By subscribing to the same <code>topic</code> on the RaspberryPi side, it is possible to detect the occurrence of an event without being exposed to the Internet.</p>
<p>I thought it would take some time to unlock, but is it practical because it will be unlocked in about 1 second after pressing the Slack button? It was within the range.</p>
<h1 id="one-day">One day&hellip;</h1>
<p>One day around 20 o&rsquo;clock, I received a visit notification from the call button in the laboratory while working at home.</p>
<p>Apparently, the teacher remained on this day, and he was out for a while with the lights on.
Most of the visits at this time are guards, and they come with electricity. ~~ I will get angry at a later date if there is no one left on. ~~</p>
<p>At the moment when the visit notification came, I thought &ldquo;Ah&rdquo; and turned off the light remotely. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/193357/b01f54f0-9d73-48dc-44e5-e888802fed27.png" alt="slack2"></p>
<p>After this, the title incident happened.</p>
<p>**It seems that I was turning off the lights just when Morie-san was in the lab and checking the room, and he was in a panic&hellip;
Furthermore, ** It was locked by auto-lock while checking the room **.</p>
<p>I had a button that could be unlocked from the room for a while, but it seemed that I didn&rsquo;t need it, so it happened just after I removed it.</p>
<h1 id="at-the-end">at the end</h1>
<p>Guardian, I&rsquo;m really sorry to make you scared.</p>
