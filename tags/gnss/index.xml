      <description>There are quite a few situations where you want to convert latitude/longitude to a position in a Cartesian coordinate system, or obtain a linear distance from latitude/longitude** (not available).  In fact, I think many other people have written this kind of article. However, I think that the coordinate system you want to use may differ depending on the purpose. So, since I learned how to convert it into a non-moving three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with the center of gravity of the earth as the origin, I would like to summarize here with the meaning of memorandum.</description>
