      <description>This article is from [Furukawa Lab, Advent_calendar Day 23](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/flab).  #Introduction
GPLVM is an unsupervised learning method that uses Gaussian process (GP) and can estimate low-dimensional manifolds whose data are distributed in high-dimensional space. The main attraction of GPLVM is that the model is very simple and highly expandable, and theoretically easy to handle. In fact, it has been extended to more complex situations such as Bayesian estimation of hyperparameters, time series data analysis 1, multiview analysis 2, and tensor decomposition 3.</description>

      <description>I recently read [&amp;quot;Gaussian Process and Machine Learning&amp;quot;](https://www.amazon.co.jp/GaussianProcessandMachineLearning-MachineLearningProfessionalSeries-Mochihashi-Daichi/dp/4061529269) I implemented it.  The content is &amp;ldquo;3.4.2 Gaussian Process Regression Calculation&amp;rdquo; in Chapter 3. Deer is a landmark. It is easy to understand and highly recommended.
What is the Gauss process? First of all, to explain the Gaussian process in one word,
At Y=f(X) &amp;ldquo;If input X is similar, output Y is similar.&amp;quot;
It is a tool for mathematically expressing that property.</description>
