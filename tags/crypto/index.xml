      <description>#Ancient representative code  Caesar cipher (shift cipher) Cryptographic implementation Caesar encryption is performed by shifting the alphabet by a certain number of characters. When the number of shifts is n, it is called ROT N. For example, 3 is ROT3.
#encryption def encrypt(plain_text, shift_num): cipher = &amp;#34;&amp;#34; # ciphertext for char in plain_text: if(char.isupper()): # when uppercase cipher += chr((ord(char) + shift_num-65) %26 + 65) else: # when lowercase cipher += chr((ord(char) + shift_num-97) %26 + 97) return cipher #Plaintext plain = &amp;#34;draemon&amp;#34; #shift number, key s = 3 print(&amp;#34;Plain Text :&amp;#34; + plain) print(&amp;#34;shift_num :&amp;#34; + str(s)) print(&amp;#34;cipher :&amp;#34; + encrypt(plain, s)) When run</description>

      <description>It is no exaggeration to say that the modern information society is supported by cryptographic technology. Nevertheless, we are reaping the benefits without being particularly aware of cryptography. What&#39;s more, cryptography has been around for a long time, as it existed around 100 BC. In addition, Hyundai Cryptography is trying to ensure high security by making full use of advanced mathematics, and eventually it will be derived from blockchain technology.  What is the length of this history and the range of defense!</description>
