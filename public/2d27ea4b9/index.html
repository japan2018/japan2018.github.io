<pre><code>This article is the 3rd day of Advent Calendar from [Kaggle Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/kaggle).
</code></pre>
<p>&ldquo;** Kaggle I&rsquo;m interested, but it&rsquo;s scary and scary&hellip; **&rdquo; I think it will be useful for those who are thinking!</p>
<p>*The following information is as of December 2019</p>
<p>Until I meet # Kaggle</p>
<p>My background before I met Kaggle is roughly the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketer ⇒ Consultant</li>
<li>Bunka (art history major)</li>
<li>No programming experience (I touched HTML a little)</li>
<li>Black screen is in awe&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/327398/a8f8ca0e-f09c-8f84-b3af-0bed9c482057.png" alt="Figure 13.png"></p>
<p>It was like this, but I learned Python &amp; machine learning in the last year, and I&rsquo;ve managed to understand Kaggle. So, for myself, one year ago, I&rsquo;ll write that you should know this.</p>
<h1 id="target-audience">Target audience</h1>
<h3 id="to-whom">To whom?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Want to improve data analysis/machine learning skills</li>
<li>Kaggle looks fun, but has no programming experience</li>
<li>Mainly marketers and planning staff</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what">what?</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can try Kaggle and it won&rsquo;t hurt!</li>
</ul>
<p>*This is not intended for Kaggle users.
*Mainly personal subjectivity (so-called Poem)</p>
<p>#What is &ldquo;Kaggle&rdquo;?</p>
<h4 id="what-is-kaggle">What is Kaggle</h4>
<p>In a word, it is the Tenkaichi Budokai of data analysis using &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo;.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/327398/6032288b-d645-115f-c671-a97ad76e054d.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<h4 id="data-to-analyze">Data to analyze</h4>
<ul>
<li>Company provides data and theme, holds competition</li>
<li>There are various themes such as medical care, marketing, finance</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="competition-period">Competition period</h4>
<ul>
<li>About 1 to 3 months</li>
<li>Relatively long</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rank">Rank</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a machine learning model and rank it according to the prediction results of that model</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="prize-money">Prize money</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are also competitions where prize money is given to the top players</li>
<li>As of 2019/12, the 1st place in the DSB competition being held is $100,000 (about 10 million yen!)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="entry-fee">Entry fee</h4>
<ul>
<li>free!</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="registered-user">Registered user</h4>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 120,000 (as of December 2019) *<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rankings">Reference source</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="about-rank">About rank</h1>
<p>There are five ranks in Kaggle, depending on their strength.
(Strictly speaking, in addition to the strength in the competition, you can also get the rank by contributing to the Kaggle community such as Kernels, Discussion, Datasets)</p>
<ul>
<li>Grandmaster * The strongest&hellip;!</li>
<li>Master</li>
<li>Expert</li>
<li>Contributor</li>
<li>Novice *First from here</li>
</ul>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that the people who work on Kaggle (aka Kaggler) spend a great deal of time every day trying to improve their ranks in their competition.</p>
<h4 id="number-of-people-per-rank">Number of people per rank</h4>
<p>The number of people as of 2019/12 is as follows
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/327398/eda47b1b-4583-cee9-7033-3823fb007ccc.png" alt="Capture.PNG"></p>
<h4 id="image-of-each-rank">Image of each rank</h4>
<p>It is an outline and image diagram of each rank. (It&rsquo;s just subjective)
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/327398/1447c6d7-67fa-7d1c-6d45-1ca52b8c007f.png" alt="Figure 1.png"></p>
<h4 id="rank-up-condition">Rank up condition</h4>
<p>Click here for rank-up conditions. (In Competitions)
The Expert suddenly requests a medal. .. .. For beginners, I would like to aim for Expert first.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/327398/f3fb7968-48cf-b372-0069-a0d0fa48b403.png" alt="Figure 2.png"></p>
<h4 id="medal-acquisition-conditions">Medal acquisition conditions</h4>
<p>There are three types of medals: Gold, Silver and Bronze.</p>
<p>Click here for medal acquisition conditions. (In Competitions)
The exact conditions vary depending on the number of participants, but the following is a guideline.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gold: Top10</li>
<li>Silver: Top 5%</li>
<li>Bronze: Top 10% (*)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Suddenly Top 10%! You may think that, but according to one theory, even if you carefully collect the information (Notebooks, Discussion, etc.) during the competition, it seems that Bronze acquisition is not a dream &hellip; (There is a possibility of survivor bias) )</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>Benefits of doing # Kaggle</p>
<p>I have listed three advantages of doing Kaggle.</p>
<h4 id="-know-your-data-science-skills-also-proof">① Know your data science skills (also proof)</h4>
<p>Data science skills are difficult to measure unless practice is applied.
However, if you have won medals and ranks at Kaggle, you can prove your approximate data science skills. Recently, the number of companies that have adopted Kaggle is gradually increasing, and it is also evidence when stepping up.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/327398/73e1c15d-9150-a81a-a5d5-ae7c12af90e9.png" alt="Figure 4.png"></p>
<h4 id="-learn-the-know-how-of-world-data-scientists-for-free">② Learn the know-how of world data scientists (for free!)</h4>
<p>I myself learned that I participated in the competition, but Kaggle has a wonderful culture of sharing know-how and information as well as competing with others.
Especially, in &ldquo;Notebooks&rdquo;, know-how and trends of data science are explained in an easy-to-understand manner along with the code, which is recommended for beginners.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/327398/32247d9a-0991-5e0c-77d3-34ef230d1b23.png" alt="Figure 5.png"></p>
<h4 id="-you-can-understand-what-machine-learning-is-doing-at-the-level-of-skin-feeling">③ You can understand what machine learning is doing at the level of skin feeling</h4>
<p>Nowadays, machine learning is more and more embedded in everyday applications and marketing tools.
If you are doing Kaggle, you will be able to master the modeling process of machine learning, so you can understand what you can and cannot do with machine learning.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/327398/67a57b9e-1ff3-debc-0a6c-df1be4ad078f.png" alt="Figure 6.png"></p>
<h1 id="kaggle-should-start-here">Kaggle should start here</h1>
<p>There may be disagreements, but there are three personal points below.</p>
<h4 id="-machine-learningpython-if-you-have-zero-knowledge-select-matsuo-lab-textbook">① Machine learning/Python If you have zero knowledge, select &ldquo;Matsuo Lab&rdquo; textbook!</h4>
<p>Matsuo Lab of the University of Tokyo, which is famous for machine learning/AI related.</p>
<p>You can download the text of &ldquo;Data Scientist Training Course&rdquo; conducted by Matsuo Laboratory for free. This is amazing, the case!
The text and Python code carefully explain the graduation level of beginners in machine learning, so if you have difficulty understanding the contents of Kaggle, I think you should complete this.</p>
<p>▼&quot;Matsuo Lab&rdquo; text Download here
<a href="https://weblab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/gci_contents/">https://weblab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/gci_contents/</a></p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/327398/bb2ef3ae-b02a-f775-2c98-4fab853ce9de.png" alt="Figure 8.png"></p>
<h4 id="-copy-the-ones-with-the-highest-number-of-votes-in-notebooks-and-get-the-knack">② Copy the ones with the highest number of votes in &ldquo;Notebooks&rdquo; and get the knack!</h4>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the &ldquo;Notebooks&rdquo; in each competition are a treasure trove of treasure.</p>
<p>If you choose a competition that seems easy to work on, it is recommended that you copy a notebook with a high number of &ldquo;Notebooks&rdquo; Votes. Notebooks with a high number of votes are carefully selected with easy-to-understand explanations, so you can relive the flow from data acquisition to model result submission by copying, and you can get the knack of machine learning.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/327398/02ae0c82-b3ef-2edd-481e-049e7511f8db.png" alt="Figure 10.png">#### ③ It is recommended that you connect with someone, because if you are alone, there will be no information.</p>
<p>Kaggle is a basic individual game. However, the competition period is as long as 1 to 3 months, and the motivation may be lowered or it may be bogged down.</p>
<p>At that time, if you have a friend who is doing Kaggle, you can share useful information (private sharing is NG) and encourage each other, and you can enjoy Kaggle more.</p>
<p>The following three are personally recommended.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Kaggle related seminars (connpass etc.)</li>
<li>Follow Kaggle on Twitter</li>
<li>Loosely join the Kaggle community</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/327398/79c95f93-b614-4e4f-fca8-be2eb8728439.png" alt="Figure 11.png"></p>
<h1 id="at-the-end">at the end</h1>
<p>Kaggle is a great platform for beginner to advanced machine learning/data analysis.</p>
<p>When you run Kaggle, you will be able to compete with TOP data scientists all over the world, share information, and be taught. However, when I think about it carefully, this is a great thing, and while writing this article, I realized again.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/327398/83f10dab-311b-9631-f6af-ca7f32b5b866.png" alt="Figure 12.png"></p>
<p>I would like to continue to contribute to Kaggle to continue to be a good platform! (First, I want a medal&hellip;)</p>
