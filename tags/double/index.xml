      <description>When ``0.1`` is substituted for ``x`` and displayed on the console, ``0.1`` is displayed.  x = 0.1 print(x) # =&amp;gt; 0.1 It seems obvious, but 0.1 cannot be represented exactly in floating point numbers (IEEE 754). However, it is strange that print is displayed when doing print. I write down what I learned about this.
#Environment This article uses Python 3.7.
[Assumption] Floating point number Throughout this article, the term &amp;ldquo;floating point number&amp;rdquo; refers to &amp;ldquo;IEEE 754 double precision&amp;rdquo;.</description>
