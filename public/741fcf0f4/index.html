<pre><code>## Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>Have you ever experienced programming while studying programming?</p>
<p>** &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make a product even after studying&rdquo; **
** &ldquo;How do you do development in the first place?&rdquo; **
<strong>What is the requirement definition?</strong></p>
<p>In order to solve that problem, let&rsquo;s first understand the <strong>overall feeling of development</strong>.
See &ldquo;Software development process&rdquo; below</p>
<p>The programming I&rsquo;m always studying corresponds to the <strong>&ldquo;implementation&rdquo;</strong> part.
In other words, there are as many as four walls before you can exercise your programming skills.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/555158/b2a2d18b-7b3b-a97a-4bf1-2b43d7423803.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Therefore, in this article, it is necessary before starting implementation (programming),
We will explain <strong>Planning~Designing</strong> step by step.
In particular, we focus on <strong>Requirement Definitions and Design</strong> that engineers should understand.</p>
<p>In addition, it is said that 20% to 30% of the total time is spent for <strong>implementation (programming)</strong> during development.
On the other hand, 50% of the total ** is used for <strong>upstream processes</strong> such as requirements definition and design.</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>human resources who can define and design requirements will inevitably contribute to development projects</strong>.
Let&rsquo;s take this opportunity to fully develop and broaden the field of activity.</p>
<p>The chapters in this article are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Necessity of requirement definition</li>
<li>Process for defining requirements definition</li>
<li>Matters determined by requirement definition</li>
<li>How to make a basic design</li>
<li>Take another step ahead of basic design</li>
<li>Summary</li>
</ul>
<p>*Since various information is also sent on SNS, please feel free to read the article.

<h2 id="necessity-of-requirement-definition">Necessity of requirement definition</h2>
<h3 id="purpose-of-requirement-definition">Purpose of requirement definition</h3>
<p>There are roughly two types of parties involved in system development projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>** Those who &ldquo;make&rdquo; the system (developers) **</li>
<li>** People who &ldquo;use&rdquo; the system (orderers) **</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to create the system you want, there is a complete image in your head, so no problem,
In many cases, we ask the &ldquo;orderer ⇒ developer&rdquo; to develop.</p>
<p>At that time, the developer does not know what to make without ** clarifying the image in the mind of the orderer.
There is a requirement definition for the purpose of communication.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare it to everyday life.
When you&rsquo;re thirsty, would you ask me to buy a drink?</p>
<p>You can say, “Get some coffee,” or more specifically
&ldquo;<strong>Bought some hot sugar coffee. It&rsquo;s a plastic bottle, not a can!</strong>&rdquo;
I can&rsquo;t get you the coffee I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>System development is the same.
**&ldquo;What would you like to make? The purpose of the requirements definition is to clearly agree on **.</p>
<p>That is,
**Requirement definition = Advance promise that you can confirm concretely &ldquo;This is OK!&rdquo; at the time of delivery **
It is good to have an understanding such as.</p>
<h2 id="process-for-determining-requirements-definition">Process for determining requirements definition</h2>
<p>Now that we know the purpose of requirement definition, let&rsquo;s understand the three stages until the requirement definition is completed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Request</strong>: <strong>Idea</strong> such as &ldquo;I wish there was such a system&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Request</strong>: I want you to implement it in the system <strong>Rough function list</strong></li>
<li><strong>Requirements</strong>: Both parties agreed <strong>Specific function list</strong> and <strong>Implementation method</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/555158/6b94649d-2cf3-ac22-83ab-c6923a7a025b.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Communication through “examination” and “suggestions”** is required for this three-step process.
It is as follows when arranged in order.</p>
<ul>
<li>** ① Request: Issues to be solved (Orderer task) **
<ul>
<li>Current issues
-Goal (what it should be)
-Gap between current situation and goals (issues to be solved)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>** ② Request: Function to be implemented in the system (Orderer task) **
-Planning background (issues to be solved)
-Overview of the system required to solve the problem
-List of functions you want to implement concretely</li>
<li>** ③ Examination: Considering the feasibility of requirements (developer task) **
-Is it technically feasible?
-How much budget do you need?
-When is the delivery date?</li>
<li>** ④ Proposal: Return the result of consideration to the orderer (developer task) **
-Functions that can be implemented
-Amount to charge
-Delivery date</li>
<li>** ⑤ Requirement: Decisions agreed by both parties (Orderer/Developer discuss and decide) **
-List of functions implemented in the system
-In some cases, the estimated delivery date and billing amount are listed.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/555158/098c9c26-e5b2-c3cb-e29a-d47f003e93d5.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<h2 id="matters-determined-by-requirement-definition">Matters determined by requirement definition</h2>
<p>Now that we understand the flow, we will outline the items to be decided in the requirement definition.
If you organize by 3W (Why, What, How), it will be neatly organized.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why: Purpose of system development (request)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Current issues
-Goal (what it should be)
-Gap between current situation and goals (issues to be solved)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>**What: How to solve the problem **
-Business flow after system introduction
-Functional requirements
-List of functions implemented in the system
<ul>
<li>Non-functional requirements
-Various processing speed, security, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How: Specific usability and implementation method (task similar to system design)</strong>
<ul>
<li>basic design
-Screen design (UI design)
-Functional design
-Data design</li>
<li>Detailed design
-Class diagram, sequence diagram
-System architecture
-Various technologies such as technology for mounting each part</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-make-a-basic-design-screen-design-functional-design-data-design">How to make a basic design (screen design, functional design, data design)</h2>
<p>You can imagine that there are so many items to be decided in the requirement definition, but please be assured.</p>
<p>What (work flow and functional/non-functional requirements) is not an engineer,
Among the development side, there is a tendency that &ldquo;** sales person **&rdquo; and &ldquo;** sales engineer **&rdquo; are the corresponding jobs.</p>
<p>So, I will continue to dig deeper on how ** (engineering) engineers can demonstrate their abilities.
Of these, in particular <strong>the basic design is key</strong>, so this article will focus on that.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the basic design is to design the &ldquo;screen, function, data&rdquo; **.
Only then can a programmer embark on software development.</p>
<ul>
<li>** Screen design (UI design) **
-What can you do on each screen?
-Information to display (text, images, etc.) and layout
-Summarize the above into a screen transition diagram</li>
<li>** Functional design **
-Back side processing (function name and processing content)
-Data required for processing, data acquisition source (input from screen, acquisition from DB, etc.)
-Delivery destination of processed data (screen display, save to DB, etc.)</li>
<li>** Data design **
-Concrete contents of data
-Database design
-Data flow</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="screen-design-ui-design">Screen design (UI design)</h2>
<p>First of all, the element that should be decided before anything else is <strong>screen design (UI design)</strong>.</p>
<p>Since the user uses the software through the screen (UI),
First of all, getting the consent to &ldquo;Ease of use of screen&rdquo;** is the shortcut to the success of the project.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the following items are decided in the screen design.</p>
<ul>
<li>What can you do on each screen?</li>
<li>Information to display (text, images, etc.) and layout</li>
<li>Summarize the above into a screen transition diagram</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/555158/d8e1694a-8007-3ea1-ee7b-7612dfb5aa7e.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>By organizing up to this point, you can get a concrete image of the completed system.
This is the reason why the screen design is made first.</p>
<h2 id="functional-design">Functional design</h2>
<p>After the screen design (UI design) is finished, design the functions to be implemented in the system.
Please understand that the functional design is the phase in which &ldquo;the processing to be executed on the other side, necessary data&rdquo; ** is defined.</p>
<p>The necessary decisions are as described above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Back side processing (function name and processing content)</li>
<li>Data required for processing, data acquisition source (input from screen, acquisition from DB, etc.)</li>
<li>Delivery destination of processed data (screen display, save to DB, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s roughly design the function of each page that appeared in the screen transition diagram.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/555158/0cba9331-598e-e5a2-11f2-60d3b2dbaaf5.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/555158/5b940d54-8286-0214-df71-59aa207e3d59.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/555158/86c73af9-012a-a5c8-c0e9-fbb11ffb8cbe.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/555158/b5cb6277-ccdd-9d78-f119-e3bad322d415.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/555158/7366f287-7698-498f-d1a6-751f5cb1342a.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/555158/2ecebf84-9ef2-5fb3-0186-b92819d5327b.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>In this way, anyone can see <strong>what kind of program should be written</strong>.
Since the parts that make up the system are clarified, <strong>the division of roles within the team</strong> is also easy.</p>
<p>To finish the functional design, let&rsquo;s connect the screen design and the functional design.
Visualize what kind of <strong>user operation/backside processing</strong> is being performed between the screens.<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/555158/ca21ce77-1b2e-4301-8147-46dc161352fb.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>The whole picture is shown below.
*Since the amount of information will increase when you come to this point, please expand the part that interests you.</p>

<h2 id="data-design">Data design</h2>
<p>The last is data design.
With the preparations made so far, the data design can finally begin.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, there are three items to be decided.</p>
<ul>
<li>Concrete contents of data</li>
<li>Database design</li>
<li>Data flow</li>
</ul>
<p>The point to be aware of here is that there are 4 types of ** data.
Design how these four types of data flow in the system.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data to be input to the program (argument)</strong>
-Data entered by the user from the web screen
-The data to read from the database</li>
<li>** &ldquo;Return&rdquo; data from the program (return value) **
-Data to be displayed on the web screen
-Data stored in database</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="specific-contents-of-data">Specific contents of data</h3>
<p>At this stage, the abstracted data definitions such as <strong>&ldquo;Member information&rdquo;</strong> are embodied.
At the practical level, the knowledge of &ldquo;normalization&rdquo;** is required.
*If you are interested, please see <a href="https://qiita.com/mochichoco/items/2904384b2856db2bf46c">[Reference Article]</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Member Information</strong>
<ul>
<li>Full name
-Phonetic</li>
<li>mail address
-Password</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>** Product information **
<ul>
<li>Product name
-Detailed description
-Product image URL
-Genre</li>
<li>Maker
-Price
-Rating</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Purchase history</strong>
-Member ID
-Product ID</li>
<li>Purchase date
-Purchase quantity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="database-design">Database design</h3>
<p>After clarifying the contents of the data, design the database.</p>
<p>The first thing to remember is that until now, data was called by &ldquo;member information&rdquo;, &ldquo;product information&rdquo;, &ldquo;purchase history&rdquo;, etc.
From a database perspective, we use the term <strong>table</strong>.
*** &ldquo;Member table,&rdquo; &ldquo;Product table,&rdquo; &ldquo;Purchase history table,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>There are three tasks required in database design.</p>
<ul>
<li>Divide table role into <strong>&ldquo;master&rdquo;</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;history&rdquo;</strong></li>
<li>Organize <strong>reference relationships</strong> between tables</li>
<li>Transcribe the reference relationship into an <strong>ER diagram</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>*(Note) The names such as &ldquo;master&rdquo; and &ldquo;history&rdquo; are from my own point of view.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s divide the role of each table according to the following criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li>** Master: Basic information (data referenced from other tables) **
-Member table (hereinafter referred to as <strong>&ldquo;member master&rdquo;</strong>)
-Product table (hereinafter referred to as <strong>&ldquo;Product master&rdquo;</strong></li>
<li>** History: Data accumulated as the system is used **
-Purchase history table</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, &ldquo;reference relationship between tables&rdquo; organizes the relationship of <strong>reference destination/reference source</strong> with arrows.
It is easy to understand if there is no omission of data flow if <strong>Data that results from user behavior</strong> is also specified.
*In some cases, data such as the weather forecast API is brought in from outside via a network.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/555158/1a4f6990-c7fb-86b0-9d00-b7ff101bb427.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Finally, create an ER diagram, which will be the blueprint for the database, and it is complete.
*Please refer to <a href="https://it-koala.com/entity-relationship-diagram-1897">[Reference Article]</a> for details on how to write an ER diagram.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/555158/8936eb59-aca8-b7fd-549a-d56bdd1ed7e4.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<h3 id="data-flow-data-flow">Data flow (data flow)</h3>
<p>Finally, if you arrange the &ldquo;relationship between database and screen transition diagram&rdquo; <strong>,
The whole picture of the system</strong> &ldquo;Screen design x Functional design x Data design&rdquo;** can be seen.</p>
<p>Since we will write each program based on this blueprint,
Practice again and again so that you can get a good overview.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/555158/73b04fb5-b48d-005e-b9b6-d68f7d743a40.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<h2 id="going-one-step-further-in-basic-design">Going one step further in basic design</h2>
<p>If you understand up to this point, you can do basic design, so it is enough for the purpose of developing your own product.
Let&rsquo;s proceed with programming while investigating various things that we do not understand.</p>
<p>After development, since many people have posted Qiita articles on server settings for publishing services,
If it is easy to understand, please refer to <a href="https://qiita.com/tachibanayu24/items/b8d73cdfd4cbd42c5b1d">[This article]</a>.</p>
<p>In the actual development site, you cannot make a clear request to the programmer unless you make a <strong>detailed design</strong>.
After understanding the contents of this article, please study the following first.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create class diagram and sequence diagram</li>
<li>Determine system architecture</li>
<li>Decide the mounting technology for each part of the architecture</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, there are cases in which new technologies appear ** in the middle of detailed design **, as technological innovation is particularly fast these days.
Following agile development, it is also possible to proceed with “<strong>deciding while making detailed design</strong>”.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is all right if you follow the in-house development policy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="at-the-end">at the end</h2>
<p>In team development, <strong>division of roles is a prerequisite</strong>.
Let&rsquo;s draw a big picture firmly and clearly define &ldquo;who and what is made&rdquo; ** and proceed with the development smoothly.</p>
<p>Also, various information is sent on SNS, so please feel free to read the article.
