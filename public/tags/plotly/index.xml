      <description>Next time https://qiita.com/Naoya_Study/items/851f4032fb6e2a5cd5ed  With the spread of coronavirus infection, various organizations have released cool dashboards that visualize the infection status.
Example 1 WHO Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Situation Example 2 Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare new coronavirus infection domestic case Example 3 Toyo Keizai ONLINE New Coronavirus Domestic Infection Status It is cool! I want to be able to make this myself. The goal is to create a dashboard like the one above using Python&amp;rsquo;s visualization-specific data frame Dash.</description>

      <description>Draw a knot interactively with #Plotly (Python)  1.First of all This time, I will plot a knot in Plotly on a three-dimensional space. I hope it will help you with your learning.
You can do something like â†“.
See the Pen dyoyxKW by Sota Misawa (@mitawaut) on CodePen.  Source (GitHub)
2. Review Make a minimal review of how to draw the knot.
Knot (knot) is $S^1$ embedded piecewise linearly in $S^3$.</description>

      <description>Hello! This article is Kaggle&#39;s advent calendar,  Scatter plot of Python data visualization library &amp;ldquo;Plotly&amp;rdquo; I thought that it goes well with competitions such as Kaggle, so I would like to introduce it.
First of all, I would like to see a concrete example. Example 1 Plots the word&amp;rsquo;s distributed representation with 3D compression Example 2 Plot rental data for 23 wards of Tokyo on map data What do you think!</description>

      <description># at first  A library called Plotly Express (official site) that allows you to easily draw interactive operations based on javascript was released a while ago. I found. Since I felt a potential of a dimension that was clearly different from the static drawing that I have used so far, I have summarized the method of drawing a basic visualization method also as a memo. For reference, I am comparing it with the pattern that I wrote a similar figure in matplotlib+seaborn.</description>
