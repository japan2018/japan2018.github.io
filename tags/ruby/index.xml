      <description>#Introduction  AtCoder Problems is used to solve past problems. Thank you, AtCoder and AtCoder Problems.
This time AtCoder Regular Contest C-Factors of Factorial Difficulty: 925
This theme, factorization
It is a problem such as a simplified version of * that I solved before * AtCoder ABC057 C prime factorization bit exhaustive search with Ruby and Python*.
Although it is called factorial, integer factor overflow can be seen in C language when actually factoring, so that point may be Difficulty high.</description>

This time AtCoder Beginner Contest B-Template Matching Difficulty: 828
This theme, matrix operation
It&amp;rsquo;s a two-dimensional array, but using a library of matrices can be easier to do.
Ruby require&amp;#39;matrix&amp;#39; class Matrix #Not assignable in v2.3 def []=(i, j, x) @rows[i][j]=x end end n, m = gets.split.map(&amp;amp;:to_i) rows = Array.new(n + m){gets.chomp.chars.map{|c| (c ==&amp;#39;#&amp;#39;) ?</description>

This time AtCoder Beginner Contest 107 B-Grid Compression Difficulty: 434
This theme, string operation
Ruby h, w = gets.split.map(&amp;amp;:to_i) a = [] h.times do |i| s = gets.chomp a.push(s) if s.index(&amp;#39;#&amp;#39;) end (w-1).downto(0) do |i| if a.all?{|x| x[i] ==&amp;#39;.&amp;#39;} a.each do |x| x[i] =&amp;#39;&amp;#39; end end end puts a a.push(s) if s.count(&amp;#39;.&amp;#39;) != w a.</description>

This time AtCoder Regular Contest 086 C-Not so Diverse Difficulty: 431
This theme, hash sorting
Ruby Speaking of duplicate lists, it&amp;rsquo;s a hash.
n, k = gets.split.map(&amp;amp;:to_i) a = gets.split.map(&amp;amp;:to_i) h = Hash.new(0) a.each do |x| h[x] += 1 end puts n-h.values.sort.reverse[0, k].inject(:+) h.sort_by{|key, v| -v}.each do |key, v| puts n-h.values.sort.reverse[0, k].inject(:+) ~~Ruby doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a destructive sort of hashes, but it seems to have few uses.</description>

This time AtCoder Grand Contest 033 A-Darker and Darker Difficulty: 1245
This theme, breadth-first search
Ruby This is an advanced version of AtCoder Typical Contest 002 A-breadth-first search that I solved earlier. In particular, there are severe conditions such as execution time limit: 1 sec.
h, w = gets.split.map(&amp;amp;:to_i) cm = Array.new(h + 2){Array.new(w + 2, 0)} que = [] 1.</description>

This time AtCoder Beginner Contest 131 D-Megalomania Difficulty: 594
This theme, array sort
Ruby It&amp;rsquo;s an array sort, so I think it&amp;rsquo;s easy to implement. ~~ I chose a lighter problem because it is the first Python. ~~
n = gets.to_i a = Array.new(n){gets.split.map(&amp;amp;:to_i)} a.sort_by!{|x| x[1]} ans = 0 n.times do |i| ans += a[i][0] if ans &amp;gt;a[i][1] puts &amp;#34;No&amp;#34; exit end end puts &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; a.</description>

      <guid>https://memotut.com/enumeration-of-prime-numbers-in-one-line-a1eb3/</guid>
      <description>#Introduction  I suddenly wrote a program that finds prime numbers in one line. Emphasis on code volume, not efficiency.
Ruby If you think it is a filter, it is select in case of Range. (Ruby 2.5)
(2..99).select {|x| (2...x).select {|i| x %i == 0} == []} Python You can use filter, but the list comprehension is cleaner.
[x for x in range(2, 100) if [i for i in range(2, x) if x %i == 0] == []] Haskell Haskell can&amp;rsquo;t get out of a beginner who is studying for years.</description>

      <description>In October 2019, I attended a certain programming school where I often see advertisements on youtube, and since November I have been in my current position as a machine learning engineer and data scientist.  Three months after graduating, I would like to write about what I learned from the school, what was useful, and what is difficult now.
Biography April 2015 Served as a research and development position for a food company for 4 years July 2019 Start of programming school learning October 2019, graduated from programming school November 2019 Job change as a machine learning engineer and data scientist</description>

      <description>#Introduction  I wrote Things like this before, but as an artisan, I was tempted to make my own tools.
 https://github.com/Kray-G/kinx  Looks like JavaScript, feels like Ruby, and it is the script language fitting in C programmers.    Well, even if you say no, it&amp;rsquo;s something you can find somewhere (I won&amp;rsquo;t say it here), but I&amp;rsquo;m lonely even if I&amp;rsquo;m self-satisfied, so let&amp;rsquo;s leave a footstep for commentary.</description>

      <description>When you touch a variety of languages, the detailed characteristics of the language and the usage of symbols are getting messed up, regardless of the important characteristics of the language. How do you write that this is this language? It often happens. Even though I used to use a language that I used to use a lot, I sometimes feel shocked that I have forgotten it even after a short distance.</description>

      <guid>https://memotut.com/why-vbscript-true-is-1-4ef82/</guid>
      <description>According to the following documentation, VBScript&#39;s True is equivalent to `-1`.  True keyword 
Also, False is equivalent to 0.
False keyword 
On the other hand, in the C language, true is equivalent to 1 and false is equivalent to 0 in stdbool.h.
#ifndef __cplusplus  #define bool _Bool #define true 1 #define false 0  #else /* __cplusplus */Also, in JavaScript, if you cast true to an integer type, it will be 1.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  There are various Python version/library management and it is complicated. It seems easy for Rubyist to think &amp;ldquo;what is said in Ruby?&amp;rdquo;, so I will summarize the current mainstream Python environment management.
