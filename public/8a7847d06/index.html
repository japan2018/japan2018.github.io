</p>
<pre><code>## Motivation
</code></pre>
<p>(Summary) Just because I wanted to know. There is no better reason.</p>
<details><summary>More details</summary><div>
<p>There are many types of garbled patterns.
Garbled characters that occur when displaying UTF8 files in SJIS,
Garbled characters that occur when displaying UTF8 in EUC,
Garbled characters that occur when displaying EUC in UTF8&hellip;
You can check what each looks like on this page (<a href="https://tools.m-bsys.com/ex/html-mojibake.php)">https://tools.m-bsys.com/ex/html-mojibake.php)</a>.</p>
<p>To be honest, since I work on UTF8 recently, I haven&rsquo;t seen much garbled characters.
However, at the workplace where I entered as a new graduate, the creation of text files was based on SJIS. Then, opening UTF8 files with SJIS and causing garbled characters was relatively frequent.
If the characters are garbled from UTF8 to SJIS, the characters are often garbled, such as `,,,,,,,,,,,. You can see that the same kanji appears again and again.</p>
<p>There is a bias in the kanji that appear as garbled characters.
I just wanted to know the frequently used kanji and their meaning&hellip;.
But surprisingly I couldn&rsquo;t find an article with that kind of content, so I can&rsquo;t help writing it&hellip;
That&rsquo;s why my <strong>especially insignificant curiosity</strong> was the driving force behind this article.</p>
</div></details>
<h2 id="reason-why-only-the-same-kanji-appears">Reason why only the same kanji appears</h2>
<p>As for the reason why all the characters are the same, I will omit them here because a wonderful article was written last year.
<a href="https://qiita.com/kaityo256/items/878cbe35d4c8444b045a">If you garble from UTF-8 to SJIS, you will often see thread-balanced kanji</a></p>
<h2 id="aggregation-method">Aggregation method</h2>
<p>Based on an appropriate long sentence, garbled characters in <strong>Original UTF8 → SJIS display</strong> are generated and saved in a file, and the kanji are counted in Python.</p>
<p>No matter how bright a sentence is, if you display it in SJIS and save it again as UTF8, you can quickly change it into a memorable one. I can&rsquo;t help feeling the immortality of this world.</p>
<p>The long sentence is what to choose, but here I&rsquo;ll probably use something that everyone knows.
Let&rsquo;s count each by Soseki Natsume&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kokoro&rdquo; in the high school textbook and Dazai Osamu&rsquo;s &ldquo;Running Melos&rdquo; in the junior high school textbook. The main one is &ldquo;Kokoro&rdquo;, and the ranking of the short story &ldquo;Run Meros&rdquo; is about bonus.</p>
<p>The texts are on the Aozora Bunko, so I copied and created the data from there.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000148/files/773_14560.html">Souseki Natsume &ldquo;Kokoro&rdquo;</a>
<a href="https://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000035/files/1567_14913.html">Osamu Dazai &ldquo;Run Meros&rdquo;</a></p>
<p>The program specifically wrote python code with no interest.</p>

It can be said that &ldquo;Meguriai&rdquo; can also be written as &ldquo;Meguriyo&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Maigurai&rdquo; can also be written as &ldquo;Mairei&rdquo;.

<p>It is a character that represents the legume of the plant. It looks like beans have become difficult.
It seems that the princess of Emperor Tetsukaku, Sasage no Ojo, came around the 6th century.</p>
<p>It is unclear if this is related, but beans called Sasage are an annual herb belonging to the genus Cowpea that has been eaten in Japan for a long time. Currently, red bean is used for most of the red rice for celebrations, but in the past, cowpeas were especially preferred and used. During the Edo period, the skin of azuki beans was easily broken when they were boiled, and it was disliked by samurai warriors, saying that &ldquo;beans that run out of stomach lead to the belly.&rdquo; Therefore, it is said that cowpea with thick skin was used for red rice. Even now, it seems that some red rice fundamentalists claim that cowpea red rice is the real red rice.</p>

<p>Read &ldquo;Hagusa&rdquo; in the reading. It is a weed that resembles rice, but grows only with leaves and does not grow. For example, Enocorogusa, which is famous as a cat, is the case. It looks like rice, but it doesn&rsquo;t grow. In turn, it seems to be used as an illustration of bad things. So Yugen is a harmful and ugly word. Well, I don&rsquo;t use it.</p>

Shikanjima is a kimono pattern that was popular in the Edo period. It was a correct combination of four vertical stripes and a ring (a metal ring), and it was correct to write &ldquo;four stripes&rdquo;, but it was the third generation of Kabuki actors. It seems that this kanji was named after Utaemon&rsquo;s haiku title &ldquo;Shiba Su&rdquo;.

It seems that there are various theories, but according to the Seto Ochihoshu published in the 5th Year of Culture (1808), the slope is divided into &ldquo;earth&rdquo; and &ldquo;anti&rdquo; and it can be read as &ldquo;return to earth&rdquo;. It is said that there were some people who disliked and used &ldquo;saka&rdquo; if it was not good. If you write Osaka from Seya, it&rsquo;s akan. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Rasengan! ! ! Not. It is not an insect bias, but a thread bias.
&ldquo;Kashi&rdquo; is a very niche kanji that represents a rope that constrains a sinner.
It seems that it is mainly used as a set with &ldquo;Setsu&rdquo;, as in &ldquo;Rikei/Kokugoku Bidan&rdquo;, it says, &ldquo;Now, I will not commit suicide by ruining the humiliation of Ruisetu.&rdquo; The kato seems to have the meaning of being tied up.</p>
<p>Before the Showa era, there was no metal handcuffs, so we tied the sinner with a rope. In the Edo period, the rope trapping technique (Tojojutsu/Torinawajutsu) was widely used as a part of catching surgery (martial arts to control the enemy without killing the enemy with bare hands). There are &ldquo;Hayanawa&rdquo; for quickly restraining the enemy who has been seized, &ldquo;Honora&rdquo; formal and ceremonial use, &ldquo;Torture rope&rdquo; for adding torture by bondage, etc., depending on the status, occupation, sex, and use of the opponent It seems that different binding methods were prepared. Rope trapping is a well-known martial art, and there were 150 schools in the Edo period. Wow.</p>

<p>There is a word &ldquo;ungen&rdquo;.
To put it simply, a slogan is an old gradation. It came from the western part of China and was used for Buddhist paintings in the Nara and Heian eras, temple decoration and dyeing and weaving.
And there is a color term called &ldquo;ungensaishiki&rdquo;. I think you can see the concrete picture. It seems that it will come out in color tests, so maybe some web designers may know. <a href="http://colorterms.kisochishiki.com/culture/ungensaishiki.html">Reference: What is the meaning of halo color</a>
There is a treasure of Shosoin, Urushikin Pakue no Ban, which has easy-to-understand colors.

If you look closely, the colors of the same system will overlap in layers, rather than overlapping and overlapping colors, right? This is the coloring of the object.

<p>With an overwhelming number of appearances of 60,000 times, he earned a score unrivaled by others.
The king of the garbled world of UTF8→SJIS won the strongest Kanji character &ldquo;Mito&rdquo;, which is the strongest Itokiso Musketeer!</p>
<p>I often hear the kanji that expresses &ldquo;tangle&rdquo;, such as &ldquo;mochi-no-tetsu&rdquo;.
Entanglement is the intertwining. Say “Unravel the yarn”.
Misleadingly, there are two words, &ldquo;fray&rdquo; and &ldquo;tangle.&rdquo;
As indicated by the kanji, “Unravel” and “Tangle”,
Unraveling is unraveling, and tangles are entwining, so the meaning is exactly the opposite. Let&rsquo;s watch out.</p>
<p>Tongue tangling means that you can&rsquo;t even say things because your tongue is messy.
To be specific, withdrawal engineers like me often squeak when talking with people who meet for the first time.
Tangled hair is tangled hair. Disturbed hair.
Specifically, it is a general engineer&rsquo;s hairstyle.
Kanji suitable for an engineer won the first place! ! ! (Noisy)</p>
<h2 id="result-announcement-run-meros-category">Result announcement &ldquo;Run Meros&rdquo; category</h2>
<p>If you end it only with &ldquo;heart&rdquo;, the above result will be valid only for &ldquo;heart&rdquo;, right? ? ? Wouldn&rsquo;t the other sentences have completely different results? ? ? I tend to think that, so just in case, I tried ranking in other sentences. Although the ranking has changed a little, the results are almost similar except for a part.
Meros is a short story, so the amount of text is small.</p>
<p>41st place: 20 times (out of rank)
32nd Subaru: 24 times (out of rank)
22nd place: 48 times (out of rank)
―――――――――――――――
20. Tan: 54 times new! (Adventure Tan)
19th place: 56 times
18th place Reconnaissance: 57 times new! (Recon of reconnaissance)
17th place: 59 times
16th place: 63 times
15th generation: 76 times
14th place: Emi: 80 times
13th place: 92 times
12th place: 98 times
11th place: 98 times
10th Doctor: 111 times
9th place: Nagi: 117 times
8th encouragement: 149 times
** 7th place: 156 times new!
6th place: 222 times
5th place: 224 times
4th place: Nine: 290 times
3rd place: 753 times
2nd place: 933 times
1st place: 2944 times</p>
<p>The second point is &ldquo;Partner&rdquo; partner ** &ldquo;Partner&rdquo; is ranked in 7th place **.
Actually, &ldquo;Ku&rdquo; was incompletely burned in &ldquo;Kokoro&rdquo; with 78th place of 172 appearances, but at Meros, he showed his full ability. With the leap of partners, &ldquo;complaint&rdquo; also has a look of joy.</p>
<p>Actually, the word &ldquo;Oku&rdquo; is also posted on another article, &ldquo;<a href="https://qiita.com/kaityo256/items/878cbe35d4c8444b045a">Kanji of thread deviation often appears when garbled from UTF-8 to SJIS</a>'&rsquo;, but when the characters of ``Dachiditsuzu Tedetododona Nunnune no Habapahibi Pif Buphebepe Hobo Pomam Memoyaya Yuyo Yoralil Relo Ewa Ewa Wombukaga&rsquo;&rsquo; are garbled. come out. So, when you mess up &ldquo;Meros&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;Goku&rdquo; appears twice like &ldquo;Gokujutsu&rdquo;, but in &ldquo;Kokoro&rdquo;, the ratio of katakana is higher than the current text. That&rsquo;s quite a few, so it&rsquo;s undeniable that the players were forced into a somewhat unfavorable battle. If Itokyoku Musketeer were to become Itoyoki Shitenno, then his weakest position would definitely be a &ldquo;jitter&rdquo; player.</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">in conclusion</h2>
<p>This is the Proglaming&rsquo;s lottery&hellip; It&rsquo;s Paisonkai&hellip;</p>
<p>It would be great if you could find out that the scary kanji that appeared as a result of garbled characters were surprisingly interesting when you examined them. The hateful mystery Kanji is also alive Kanji because of the background of literature and history, so please don&rsquo;t bully me.</p>
