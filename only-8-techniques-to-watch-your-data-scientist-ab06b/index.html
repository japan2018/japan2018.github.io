<pre><code>#Beware of data scientists
</code></pre>
<p>As of 2019, there should be a lot of people out there who want to be distracted by data scientists. However, those who don&rsquo;t know how to be more pretentious than others. I completely removed the muddy data scientist aspect and wondered how I could be distracted.
You can put your conclusion into practice immediately tomorrow. If you want to be a data scientist, give it a try.</p>
<h2 id="1-apple">1. Apple</h2>
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/204712/63400f77-5c02-3724-0b49-5511d3ed7980.jpeg" width="200">
A sophisticated product is essential as a pretending data scientist.
Carry your MacBook with you so you can always look like a starbucks.
If you can, it's Pro. Take Pro with you.
<h2 id="2-editor-is-vscode">2. Editor is VSCODE</h2>
<p>&lt;img src=&quot;https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/204712/e8d86648-b700-a30e-7d49-7f427a5325fe.png&rdquo; width=&quot;170&rdquo;)&gt;
When I open my MacBook, it&rsquo;s VSCODE.
What is good about VSCODE? I will answer like this.
&ldquo;Hmm, lightness first, and abundant extensions, the most attractive point is remote debugging.&rdquo;
Editors are always required to be light. Colleagues and friends must be impressed by the fashionable sounds of extensions and remote debugging.</p>
<h2 id="3-love-python">3. Love Python</h2>
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/204712/10124f0a-c0c0-c117-e5d5-b0a113643791.png" width="300">
If you're a data scientist, you're bound to love Python.
Not only Python, which is an extension of VSCODE, but PyCharm needlessly be installed. It is a manifestation of my love for Python. And never deny R. Let's feel that R knows that R has some good points even though I don't understand R at all.
<h2 id="4-visualize-to-breathe">4. Visualize to breathe</h2>
<img width="300" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/204712/ab6db9a7-5cc8-2cd5-2595-be93990beccb.png">
<p>Visualization is one of the highlights of data scientists.
Once you have the data, visualize it with haste, no matter what.
Also, tell a colleague who writes graphs with MatPlotLib, &ldquo;I recommend using Plotly for visualization now. It&rsquo;s more convenient to see data interactively.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="5-stick-to-python-notation">5. Stick to Python notation</h2>
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/204712/4260c862-a879-3b71-6cb1-ec1a9a3b3cd9.jpeg" width="200">
Since Python is used, let's try Pythonic programming. Let's write stylish code that looks like a functional type, using not only list comprehensions but also walrus operators that have been supported in the latest update.
<h2 id="6-dont-forget-cc">6. Don&rsquo;t forget C/C++</h2>
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/204712/d6db0a3e-985a-bc2c-e340-618996e978dc.png" width="200">
If you love only Python, it will be bullied by core people in terms of speed. So sometimes I'll appeal to myself, "I might need to write in C at the end." People around us will be yearning to have knowledge from data science to product release.
<h2 id="7-say-cloud-once-a-day">7. Say Cloud once a day</h2>
<p>&lt;img src=&quot;https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/204712/7544d416-64da-7718-2868-dc0a431fc1b1.png&rdquo;, width=&quot;200&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/204712/a08b87f1-c054-d830-6f2a-657beddf5217.jpeg&rdquo;, width=&quot;200&quot;&gt;
Not using the cloud is not data science. Let&rsquo;s bring up the topic of AWS and GCP. And let&rsquo;s repeat the keyword scaling. More specifically, if you can use terms such as S3 and IAM, it is even better. Show off the size of the field that can be used on-premise or in the cloud.</p>
<h2 id="8-make-a-wind-that-knows-kaggle">8. Make a wind that knows kaggle</h2>
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/204712/7419fa67-9091-0023-c174-9f170edaeb39.png" width="200">
Longing for data scientists, Kaggle's Grand Master. Of course, let's bring up the topic of "It's a Kaggle competition recently..." in order to create an atmosphere that kaggle is always checked.
The appearance of always aiming for height should be a target of admiration.
<p>#Why I wrote this article
This article is to &ldquo;take care&rdquo; of data scientists who are said to be one of the most glamorous jobs at the end of 2019. The trigger was the situation around me when I attended a conference of a super famous IT company. It was almost the same, and it was very interesting. I&rsquo;ve written it purposely, but I&rsquo;m going to write the right thing to some extent. We&rsquo;ll talk a little bit seriously about each and include helpful links and tips.</p>
<h2 id="1-i-love-apple">1. I love apple</h2>
<p>Personally, I think it&rsquo;s okay for Windows, but I feel that it is excellent in terms of environment construction and compatibility with Linux. Many people recommend Mac. Of course, I think there are also Apple followers.

<a href="https://yukiyoshisato.hatenablog.com/entry/2018/07/28/090336">What I did before becoming a data scientist</a></p>
<h2 id="2-editor-is-vscode-1">2. Editor is VSCODE</h2>
<p>I personally think this is one option. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll write Python outside of VSCODE, and so does Markdown. The draft I am writing this article for is also VSCODE. I personally don&rsquo;t really feel the reason for choosing another editor.

<a href="https://qiita.com/sensuikan1973/items/74cf5383c02dbcd82234">24 recommended extensions of VS Code (and some Tips)</a></p>
<h2 id="3-love-python-1">3. Love Python</h2>
<p>If this is also data science, I wonder if it can be removed now.
All machine learning frameworks are provided in Python and are very compatible with Cloud.

<p>Also, if you use Flask etc., you can easily write a little web application, and various applications are easy to work. I think Python is excellent because I think the speed of trial and error is important for a job like trial and error that repeats like data science.</p>
<h2 id="4-visualize-to-breathe-1">4. Visualize to breathe</h2>
<p>I think visualization is one of the most important items for data science. I wrote it playfully in the upper part, but Matplotlib is commonplace, and now Plotly and Dash are quite recommended.
I think it is important to display data so that it can be said that human beings can understand that what controls visualization is data control. (Personal opinion)

<h2 id="5-stick-to-python-notation-1">5. Stick to Python notation</h2>
<p>This area is a bit maniac, but by using list comprehension notation, Map, Lambda, you can achieve what you want with short, clean code. And it can also contribute to speeding up.
Some people say that it isn&rsquo;t easy to read, but I&rsquo;m used to it to some extent.

<h2 id="6-dont-forget-cc-1">6. Don&rsquo;t forget C/C++</h2>
<p>After all, I want to make a new library, think about advanced things, or even faster, I need C++. You may need C if you want to write something close to the hardware. Of course, there are limits to interpreter languages, so languages like C++ cannot of course be stupid. Needless to say here.

<h2 id="7-say-cloud-once-a-day-1">7. Say Cloud once a day</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s so big that I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m not using the cloud in today&rsquo;s employment interview, so it&rsquo;s natural that I need to catch up. Even if you just started data science, if you can use ElasticSearch, Tableau, Jupyter&rsquo;s development environment quickly, or use many functions of SageMaker, it will be convenient. Data science can be started in a day.

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that it is necessary to participate in the kaggle competition, but there are many parts that will be helpful for visualization techniques and how to create features, so please pay attention to the competition you are interested in. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s bad to pass it.</p>
<p>Especially recently, kaggle&rsquo;s kernel is also easy to use, so you can feel free to touch the data.

<h1 id="in-conclusion">in conclusion</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s already the end of the year, so I made a playful article.
I hope you will find it a little bit crazy.
The end.</p>
