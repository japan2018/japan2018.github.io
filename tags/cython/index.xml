      <description>#Introduction  In recent years, the field of model-free deep reinforcement learning has been actively studied due to the success of AlphaGo and DQN. These algorithms are one of the effective approaches when the state-action space is very large or when mathematical modeling of dynamics is difficult. However, in many of the problems encountered in reality, mathematical modeling of the environment is relatively easy, and the state-action space can be reduced by devising it in many cases.</description>
