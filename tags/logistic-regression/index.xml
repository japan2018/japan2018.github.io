      <description>#Introduction  I have summarized what I learned about odds and logit transformation, which are prerequisites for understanding logistic regression.
##reference In understanding the odds and logit conversion, I have referred to the following.

      <description>#1. Purpose  If you want to do machine learning, anyone can use scikit-learn etc. to implement it relatively easily. However, in order to achieve results at work or to improve your level, The explanation &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand the background, but I got this result&amp;rdquo; is clearly weak.
In this article, the two aims are to &amp;ldquo;use the scikit-learn first because the theory is good&amp;rdquo; and to &amp;ldquo;understand the background from mathematics&amp;rdquo; from the fourth and later.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  The Pokemon Sword Shield was launched last month. By the way, have you ever played Pokemon? As anyone who has played Pokemon will know, Pokemon has the ability value which consists of HP, Kogeki, Bogyo, Tokukou, Tokubo, and Quickness. It can be said that the higher the ability value is, the stronger the Pokemon is. Ability score is calculated from three values: race value, individual value and effort value.</description>
