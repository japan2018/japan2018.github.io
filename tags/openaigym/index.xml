      <description>It is a prerequisite that you have achieved up to 10 reinforcement learning.  If you google with openai acrobot, Acrobot-v1 will come out. I do not know v1 or v0 well, so I will investigate before the magic modification. userfolder/anaconda3/envs/chainer/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gym With VS Code. A full search with CartPole found CartPole-v0 and CartPole-v1. Mumu? For acrobot, only Acrobot-v1. In CartPole created earlier, I tried to replace CartPole-v0 with CartPole-v1. The difficulty level seems to have increased.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Do you guys do it?
Machine learning
He has been touted for the last three years as the third AI boom. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, deep learning I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying silently these days, but it&amp;rsquo;s kind of difficult&amp;hellip;
This time, let&amp;rsquo;s leave that area and create a machine learning environment quickly. It&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly easy to make. (I think there are many reference articles, but I also use them as notes for myself)</description>
