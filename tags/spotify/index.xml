      <description>This article is the 22nd day article of [NTT Communications Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/nttcom).  Yesterday was @kanatakita&amp;rsquo;s article, &amp;ldquo;A story I want to beat the conference necessary to release the application&amp;rdquo; (https://qiita.com/kanatakita/items/a68c6e7758524422ecb0).
#Introduction Hi, my name is yuki uchida, and I belong to the SkyWay team of NTT Communications. This article is the second series of &amp;ldquo;I want to visualize&amp;rdquo; after Hands-on to visualize my tweet while understanding BERT.
When I was hitting Spotify&amp;rsquo;s API privately, I thought that I could make interesting visualizations related to the recommendation system, which is my personal interest range, so I am writing this article.</description>
