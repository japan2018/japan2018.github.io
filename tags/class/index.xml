      <description>### This is the second day article of PythonAdventCalendar2019.  Write common mistakes.
 Many methods are defined, but no class is defined.
 I had a source with a lot of methods and a lot of functionality.
There was a person who said that there is no problem with software that Python works as a function.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t create useless instances, you wonder why there are none,
I said &amp;#34;why doesn&amp;#39;t this source have a class?</description>
