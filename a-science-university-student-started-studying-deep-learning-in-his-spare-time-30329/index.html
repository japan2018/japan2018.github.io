<pre><code>#Introduction
</code></pre>
<h3 id="my-specs">My specs</h3>
<p>I gave the title &ldquo;Science University Student&rdquo;, but I think there is a punch like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually an information student&rdquo; only in these articles. If so, it will be an article that hopeless for university students who are not information systems, so I will clarify my features first. I am in the second year of university, belonging to the Department of Physics, Faculty of Science. I&rsquo;m in the manufacturing circle, so programming (Python) is a bit of a bit of skill, but I&rsquo;m just a beginner in deep learning**.</p>
<p>Since I was free during spring break, I started studying deep learning. To be honest, deep learning is a technology that cannot be avoided not only in the field of information systems but also in other fields in the future. If I had to study later, I started studying because I had no time to study. Even at the time of writing, I started studying for about two weeks. So I&rsquo;m still in the beginners&rsquo; field, but in this article I would like to tell you <strong>how much a beginner will study for two weeks</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="target">Target</h3>
<p>The target audience for this article is anyone who wants to study deep learning but hasn&rsquo;t taken the first step. This article is a real story of my experience, so I think it will be helpful in planning your studies. If you are already studying and developing deep learning, read it as an entertainment, thinking it is like a baby&rsquo;s growth diary.</p>
<p>By the way, this is my first post. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know much about it, but please understand it.</p>
<h1 id="first-day">First day</h1>
<p>First of all, you need to collect information online. I also searched on Qiita, but since there is a lot of information on those who are strong in deep learning in the first place, I searched while distinguishing there. I think that most beginners tend to want books, so if you go to &ldquo;Deep Learning Book Recommendations&rdquo;, you can get information easily. Apparently, the book &ldquo;Deep Learning from scratch&rdquo; was recommended for beginners, so I bought it on Amazon for now.</p>
<p>I asked Google about what kind of deep learning frameworks there are and which ones are major. For major items, information is available online and in books. It is also important to check whether it is major.</p>
<h1 id="days-2-7">Days 2-7</h1>
<p>I started to read &ldquo;Deep Learning from scratch&rdquo; that I just purchased. It consists of 8 chapters, so if you study 1 chapter a day, it will be completed in 8 days. The table of contents is as follows <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I skipped chapter 1 because I knew it. I read Chapters 2 and 3 in one day, and read the others one by one. It feels like I read it in 6 days. First of all, I thought about how to write the code by myself, and if I could not think for about 3 minutes, I copied it. The contents were very easy to understand. As the title suggests, a neural network is created from zero, and the library is basically implemented without using it. However, you may be prompted to import the code written by the author on the way. If you are not satisfied, the code is open to the public and you can just look at it. Even so, I was a little surprised that the neural network was simpler than I expected.</p>
<p>I hope this book will give you a rough understanding of <strong>the processing flow in neural networks</strong>. From a personal point of view, I think it&rsquo;s more memorable to get the whole picture when you get started with something, rather than dig deep into each one. This book doesn&rsquo;t go deep enough, so the content came in.</p>
<p>As I am a student of the physics department, I am very welcoming in mathematical formulas. However, the formulas in this book are the minimum necessary. I don&rsquo;t need to show the rigorous formulas in the text, so it&rsquo;s helpful for me to include them in the appendix. Also, the mathematical expressions in this book were not familiar with the style of mathematical expressions, perhaps because they gave priority to the ease of understanding for those who are not familiar with mathematics. That said, it doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t understand it, so I think it was good to read the first volume overall.</p>
<p>#Day 8
Honestly, just because I read &ldquo;Deep Learning from scratch&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean that I can make something. I entered the information collection turn again to find the next guideline. The target of the search is a deep learning framework or library. I found TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras and so on, but I chose Keras, which has the shortest name, because I liked everything. Then, I searched for a book written in Keras and posted on Amazon what looks good.</p>
<p>The next thing I got was &ldquo;<strong>Intuition Deep Learning</strong>&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s book again. O&rsquo;Reilly books are sometimes strangely translated and not in Japanese, but I am an O&rsquo;Reilly believer. The reason I chose this book is to learn Keras and to know the application of deep learning. Looking at the application examples, it&rsquo;s a courage to try to do something that can be done.</p>
<p>Actually, I was considering reading the second volume of &ldquo;Language learning from scratch&rdquo;, but I was not interested in natural language processing at that time, so let&rsquo;s move on to the next step. I didn&rsquo;t buy it because I thought. When doing natural language processing, I definitely recommend reading it. By the way, from this time on, I started to work on the first volume of &ldquo;PRML&rdquo;, but I will cut it off because it becomes complicated.</p>
<h1 id="days-9-12">Days 9-12</h1>
<p>I read the &ldquo;Intuition Deep Learning&rdquo; that I received. The impression of using Keras is that it&rsquo;s easy to use. I didn&rsquo;t use any deep learning library in &ldquo;Deep Learning from scratch&rdquo;, so I could feel the joy of using the library. Since the process of constructing a neural network has already been learned, all I had to do now was learn how to write it in Keras. As for how to use Keras, I read the official document alongside the book. The official document was in Japanese and very easy to read. By the way, the table of contents of &ldquo;Intuition Deep Learning&rdquo; is as follows <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I finished reading CNN implementation (Chapter 3) using Keras in 3 days. Chapter 1 per day The pace has not changed. It may be just a good guide to read while organizing the contents. Chapters 1 to 3 of this book were contents that compressed contents of &ldquo;Deep Learning from scratch&rdquo;. I thought it would be a good companion to the next book &ldquo;Deep Learning from scratch&rdquo; in that I could learn deeper knowledge and how to use Keras while reviewing it.</p>
<h1 id="days-13-14">Days 13-14</h1>
<p>The content of &ldquo;Intuition Deep Learning&rdquo; was very good, but I became interested in object detection in the middle of reading. After studying this much for the first time, I was able to understand the stories of Qiita warriors unless it was a super-deep topic, so I collected information on object detection with Qiita. And I got the words YOLO and SSD. When I was looking for a book that deals with the contents, I found a book called &ldquo;Developmental Deep Learning with PyTorch**&rdquo;. I thought it would be nice to have Keras flirt with PyTorch in less than a week, but I realized I wasn&rsquo;t a human.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Developmental Deep Learning with PyTorch&rdquo; covers quite some recent topics, but for now I can&rsquo;t understand. Perhaps the two books I read before that were a hit. For the time being, I will read this book and &ldquo;Intuition Deep Learning&rdquo; at the same time.</p>
<p>#in conclusion
It is like this when a beginner studies for two weeks. I don&rsquo;t know if my pace is slow or fast, so if you refer to this article, please adjust the pace distribution to suit your ability and environment.</p>
<p>In the future, I would like to make something that integrates IoT devices using Raspey and deep learning technology. Currently, we are making a small self-supporting rover, so we plan to use deep learning for object detection. To put it simply, it means letting the car operate automatically. In addition, I will power up a few days later and upload a study diary for deep learning.</p>
