<pre><code>## Summary
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Various people were writing the code when I searched because I wanted to record Radiko.</li>
<li>I could have just run git clone, but I was wondering what kind of processing it was doing, so I tried writing the code myself while reading the code of the predecessors.</li>
<li>As I tried it, I learned something, so I summarized it.
<ul>
<li>Protocol called hls (HTTP Live Streaming) used by Radiko</li>
<li>Processing that is performed when listening to programs on Radiko</li>
<li>How to check the processing whose specifications are not published</li>
<li>What you have learned in summary</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-i-understand">What I understand</h2>
<h3 id="the-hls-protocol-used-by-radiko">The hls protocol used by Radiko</h3>
<ul>
<li>Radiko uses hls (short for HTTP Live Streaming), a protocol for delivering media files such as video and audio.
<ul>
<li>It seems that he used flash a few years ago, but he started using [hls] or <a href="https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35104776/">flash ends in 2020</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>hls is specified in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8216">RFC8216</a>.
<ul>
<li>The server makes it possible to obtain a split media file and two types of playlists that describe how to play the split file.
<ul>
<li>Master Playlist that describes the entire distribution contents</li>
<li>Media Playlist that describes each divided file</li>
<li>Playlist is a UTF-8 text file with a .m3u8 or .m3u extension and can be referenced by a URI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The client refers to the Playlist, obtains the URI of the media file and the information necessary for playing the media file from there, and plays it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="outline-of-processing-performed-when-listening-to-programs-on-radiko">Outline of processing performed when listening to programs on Radiko</h3>
<p>As you can see in the figure below, it turns out that HTTP is used for communication between the client and server.</p>
<p><a href="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/18485/e1af5a41-499d-8c7c-c3f0-172096e2116c.png">Processing outline.png</a></p>
<h2 id="how-did-you-find-out">How did you find out</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s roughly like this. I couldn&rsquo;t go in this order smoothly, and I went back and forth several times.</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the code written by another person → understand that authorization processing and audio file acquisition processing are necessary</li>
<li>Try to write the code → I&rsquo;m calling Radiko&rsquo;s API and HTTP status code 40X is returned, so I know that something is missing</li>
<li>Check what kind of communication is being done with the developer tool of Google Chrome → Understand what was lacking by looking at the specific communication contents</li>
<li>After writing the code, I will summarize what I did this time → There were words that I could not explain well → I can see that hls and m3u8 are specified by RFC instead of Radiko&rsquo;s own specification</li>
</ol>
<p>I read the code of the following article.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/matchy2/3956266">Simple Radiko recording script</a></li>
<li><a href="https://turtlechan.hatenablog.com/entry/2019/06/24/172207">[Python] Play radio-controlled radio</a></li>
<li><a href="https://qiita.com/taittide/items/7219cc9ff6788423ab50#fn2">I made software that automatically searches and records radiko, super A&amp;G, Otozumi and Hibiki with Python3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.bluedeer.net/archives/216">Road to radiko recording (download) Part 1</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Since 1 was written in a shell script, I knew what package I needed by googled the commands I did not understand.</p>
<ul>
<li>rtmpdump to get audio files played by flash</li>
<li>Ffmpeg for converting the obtained file to MP3</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I wasn&rsquo;t sure why that preprocessing was done or what it was doing. (Not enough shell power.)
Since I was trying to write 2 and 3 in the Python I usually use, it was easy to understand, and I found that the process that I did not understand well in the shell script above was the authorization process.
In 4, I learned how to find out what kind of logic is used to generate a partial key of Radiko&rsquo;s own specifications.</p>
<p>Now that we have the packages and libraries we need, we wrote the code.
Then, as mentioned above, I called Radiko&rsquo;s API and returned an HTTP status code of 40X series, so I checked what is wrong with my code on the browser with the developer tool of Chrome.
Below is a look at the authorization process.

<p>Looking at the request content, I found out when and where the request header starts with X-Radiko-***. When I took a quick look at the code, I was overlooking it. Then, it finally came to work.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-learned-from-the-article">What I learned from the article</h2>
<p>What is hls when putting it together? What is m3u8? I wondered again, and when I checked it, I found that it was decided by RFC. If it was decided by RFC, I searched for a library that makes them easier to handle.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/m3u8/">m3u8</a>: Python m3u8 parser</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/search/?q=hls">Possible library related to hls</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The m3u8 library is easy to use and cleans my messy code.
Also, reading the RFC and understanding the terms made it easier to name the methods and variables. For example, the variables that correspond to the Master Playlist and Media playlist were very appropriate before reading the RFC, and the names were unclear when read again.</p>
<p>A book I recently read, Isao Ueda. 101 Principles of Principles of Programming I would like to learn by the third year.
There is also a saying: &ldquo;Good programmers write good code, great programmers borrow good code.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was. It was understandable when I read it, but this time, I think that understanding whether what is becoming a standard will lead to a higher level of understanding.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Through Radiko&rsquo;s recording scripting, I learned about hls and its implementation</li>
<li>I was able to experience the great benefits of knowing what is standard
<ul>
<li>Library is easy to find (you don&rsquo;t have to make unnecessary things)</li>
<li>Easy to implement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is a good opportunity to think about easy-to-read code by reading and comparing code with the same function implemented.</li>
</ul>
