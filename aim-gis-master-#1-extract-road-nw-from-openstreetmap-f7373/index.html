<pre><code>#I am still dissatisfied with the accuracy of GPS on smartphones
</code></pre>
<p>Nowadays you can easily perform GPS logging on your smartphone,
After all, there are some errors.</p>
<p>The following is the track of the vehicle traveled by MyTracks (Is it no longer usable?)
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/121181/43168fb9-bd2a-0f1f-f455-d0af1aeb88dd.png" alt="mytracks.png"></p>
<p>People can see where they ran, but I can&rsquo;t manage to make a beautiful track&hellip;
However, I do not have data such as G sensor and steering, and even if there is it, it seems difficult for an amateur to correct it.
I wanted to do something about map matching.
So where should we get the map data&hellip;?</p>
<h1 id="nice-to-make-osm">Nice to make OSM</h1>
<p>OpenStreetMap which is also used in the above figure.
I built it because I wanted a map server myself (I&rsquo;ll post how to build it later),
I used it frequently as a tile server, but I didn&rsquo;t see the data itself.</p>
<p>But what a treasure trove! I haven&rsquo;t used this until now. .. ..</p>
<p>There are road networks, POI information (though not many), and building polygons.
There may be a problem with accuracy, but it won&rsquo;t shift by tens of meters (I believe that, at least it should be better than the GPS of a smartphone).
I want to dig up the treasure.</p>
<p>Is it possible to extract road NW from #OpenStreetMap? I tried a challenge.</p>
<p>In the first place I was thinking of accessing OSM data
I was told that there is an Overpass API.
<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JA:Overpass_API">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JA:Overpass_API</a></p>
<p>Certainly it is a unique format, but if you throw a query, road NW etc. will be displayed!
That means you can get data from your own OSM server as well!
I thought.</p>
<p>I remember having put Postgresql and PostGIS in the build,
Access Postgresql, a map server.
There is! A table like that!
Looking at the table schema, there are attributes such as highway as in Overpass API.
This can go. I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>Refer to the following for the schema. ..
<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JA:Osm2pgsql/schema">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JA:Osm2pgsql/schema</a>
→ If you take the road NW, it seems to be taken from the planet_osm_line table.
This time, this table.</p>
<p>Also, since we want only the road on which the car runs, it is necessary to check what the attributes of highway are.
The following is helpful.
<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway</a>
Sidewalks such as footway are also included in the data.</p>
<h1 id="i-actually-took-it">I actually took it</h1>
<p>Looking at the schema, it seems that the way column actually has location information,
The type is &ldquo;geometry(~~)&rdquo;, and even if it is simply acquired, it cannot be read by humans.
To understand it, you need to convert the geometry type in PostGIS.
<code>ST_Astext(ST_Transform(way,4326))</code>
→ 4326 is the Projection code. It seems that there are various types, but the world geodetic system seems to be good with 4326.</p>
<p>Based on the above, as an example, the data in which the word Koshu Kaido is included in the name column is extracted with SQL.
<code>select osm_id,name,highway,z_order,ST_Astext(ST_Transform(way,4326)),way_area from planet_osm_line where name like'%Koshu Kaido%';</code></p>
<p>It will take some time,
<code>141147784 | Koshu Kaido | trunk | 8 | LINESTRING(138.089114228403 36.0716119850332,138.088936900966 36.0716665145095,・・・</code>
So I got the data. Crackling crackling w
However, there are many data that do not contain name, so it is necessary to devise the acquisition condition. .. ..</p>
<h1 id="i-want-to-take-it-all-together">I want to take it all together.</h1>
<p>I want to specify the rectangle of latitude and longitude and take only the data contained in it.
Eventually I want to take within the range specified in POLYGON.
I felt like it would take time,
If you think about it, you can do it because it is taken in the range visible in bbox with Overpass API.</p>
<p>When I looked it up, of course I could.
The condition that &ldquo;the first point of the way is included&rdquo; in the specified POLYGON can be realized by the following.
You can put this in the where clause.
<code>ST_Within( ST_StartPoint( ST_Transform(way,4326)) ,ST_GeomFromText ('POLYGON(( position 1, position 2, position 3, ..., position 1))' ,4326) )</code></p>
<p>The position of POLYGON is a space-separated pair of latitude and longitude, such as &ldquo;lon1 lat1, lon2 lat2&hellip;&rdquo;,
Separate the positions with commas. Finally, position 1 must also be described so that it forms a loop.</p>
<p>If you use this, if you have POLYGON data such as prefectures, you should be able to say &ldquo;acquire by prefecture&rdquo;.</p>
<h1 id="postgis-has-various-functions">PostGIS has various functions</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a long way to go, but it has quite a few useful features.
It is especially convenient to get the area of POLYGON. It seems to be used in the future.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/121181/8fb757b9-73f3-1b85-e522-ab99420227f6.png" alt="area.png"></p>
<p>It can be calculated that the area specified by POLYGON is about 500 square km.
Since I just want to use PostGIS functions, I just have to select to calculate.</p>
<h1 id="road-nw-data-can-be-extracted-for-the-time-being">Road NW data can be extracted for the time being</h1>
<p>This time, road NW was extracted from the OSM database.
However, since it is called map matching, it is necessary to match this extracted data with GPS data.</p>
<p>How about&hellip;
There is a way to calculate the distance from one end, but it will take too much time&hellip;</p>
<p>Tsu R-Tree</p>
<p>So next time, I will use R-Tree to match &ldquo;fast&rdquo; GPS and OSM road NW.</p>
<p>Our battle has just begun</p>
