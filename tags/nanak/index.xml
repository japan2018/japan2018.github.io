      <description># GitHub  PyNanaco
What is this  You can use selenium to access the nanaco web page and log in/out, credit charge, and set/cancel your credit card. Up to 50,000 yen can be credited with one command.  merit  50,000 yen can be charged in one operation, so it is easier than operating the web screen Work to set/release credit cards on multiple nanaco can be described in a few lines If linked with a separate cron or scheduler, nanaco charge and credit card settings can be changed by batch processing.</description>
