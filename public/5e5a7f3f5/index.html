<p>There are many generous organizations overseas, or there are many specialized books that can be read for free.</p>
<p>There are other summary articles of this series,
I would like to display translated Japanese books and original books side by side.
Especially introduced only in the field of data science.</p>
<p>Maybe that expensive original book is actually free?</p>
<p>(As of May 2020)</p>
<p>#1</p>
<h2 id="japanese-basics-of-statistical-learning-15000-yen">Japanese: Basics of statistical learning (15,000 yen)</h2>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/275572/89a29df4-04e4-9d21-05c2-ac0d110eebc9.png" alt="Statistical Learning Basics-jp.png"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s commonly called a &ldquo;castella book.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Translated in Japan in 2014, but the original was published in 2001 and about 20 years ago.
Even from the content, it was probably a revolutionary book that could systematically learn theory.
It is just an &ldquo;algorithm/theory dictionary&rdquo;.
It feels chronologically old, but the basis is always important.
If you are not good at numbers, you will never be able to read. .. ..</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="original-the-elements-of-statistical-learning">Original: The Elements of Statistical Learning</h2>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/275572/bdc997c1-56d6-8a87-8b72-90e1555ac3c4.png" alt="Statistical Learning Basics-en.png"></p>
<p>Abbreviation: ELS</p>
<p>The thickness of the book, the color of the cover, exactly Castella, I want to go to Nagasaki.
The contents are so heavy that I feel a stomach ache.</p>
<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7">Original pdf</a></p>

<h2 id="japanese-pattern-recognition-and-machine-learning-updown-16000-yen">Japanese: Pattern recognition and machine learning (up/down) (16,000 yen)</h2>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/275572/c013d55f-5638-8c34-8d58-44bc88781670.jpeg" alt="prml-jp-01.jpg"></p>

<p>Common name &ldquo;PRML&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you start machine learning, this book is recommended as much as &ldquo;Haji Pata (First Pattern Recognition)&rdquo;.
I hear it called &ldquo;bishop book&rdquo; around me.</p>
<p>-It is not a book that learns algorithms completely like the first book, but theoretically introduces pattern recognition and its surrounding algorithms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ctgk/PRML">Mr. ctgk explained the problem in notebook format</a>,[Anglo-CommunicationsSupportMaterial](<a href="https://herumi.github.io/Youcanalsoseethefamousworkfromeveryone'sassistance,suchasmakingit(prml/)">https://herumi.github.io/Youcanalsoseethefamousworkfromeveryone'sassistance,suchasmakingit(prml/)</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Because both &ldquo;Hoji Pata&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bishop book&rdquo; kill beginners, it would be hard if there was no one to teach me.)</p>

<h2 id="japanese-introduction-to-statistical-learning-with-r-7000-yen">Japanese: Introduction to statistical learning with R (7,000 yen)</h2>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/275572/e02d1d68-a832-fa59-f9b0-b178e25014e4.png" alt="Statistical Learning Introduction-jp.png"></p>
<p>Common name &ldquo;ISL&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>It seems that the name recognition is not so high compared to the above two books, but it is a well-known book.
-As a concept, if &ldquo;Basics of Statistical Learning: ESL&rdquo; is a systematic book written for people who understand mathematics, this book is written more for beginners. That.
-Certainly, the content comes from the foundation of an important idea in data science.</li>
</ul>
<p>But it&rsquo;s difficult for someone who doesn&rsquo;t know anything.
I think that it is better to have knowledge about probability distributions and regression analysis in advance so that you will not have to worry about it.</p>
<p>The text is long. I think it&rsquo;s done carefully to make it easier to understand, but sometimes the story doesn&rsquo;t come in.</p>
<h2 id="original-an-introduction-to-statistical-learning-with-applications-in-r">Original: An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R</h2>

<p>The topic of deep learning these days.
A book written by Dr. ian Dai, the developer of the particularly hot generation model &ldquo;GAN&rdquo;.
If you understand and understand &ldquo;deep learning from scratch&rdquo;, I would recommend this book as the next book.
A book that advances while learning the knowledge of analysis and linear algebra necessary for deep learning in order.</p>
<p>Even if you can not read it, the cover may be beautiful so you can make it an interior?</p>
<h2 id="original-deep-learning">Original: Deep learning</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.deeplearningbook.org/">Original pdf</a></p>
<p>#5</p>
<h2 id="japanese-statistical-causal-reasoning--model-reasoning-guessing--10000-yen">Japanese: Statistical Causal Reasoning -Model, Reasoning, Guessing- (10,000 Yen)</h2>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/275572/c836c0ca-9995-c033-b7be-7dee55487c84.png" alt="casual-jp.png"></p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read much yet, but the book of the author who won the Turing Prize by developing causal reasoning.
What is causal reasoning? When I thought about buying a book, I found this book and Iwanami Data Science.</p>
<p>Is it really a variable that should be included in the model when creating a statistical model? Does it really affect the forecast target? A book you want to read when thinking about.</p>
<p>General notes about model selection and linear regression will be learned in the third volume, &ldquo;Introduction to Statistical Learning by R,&rdquo; and the relationships between variables will be understood in this book.</p>
<h2 id="original-casuality-models-reasoning-and-inference">Original: casuality models reasoning and inference</h2>
<p>The Japanese translation is the first edition, and the original image of this is the second edition.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/275572/20235b6c-a232-a50a-7f67-4ea3e33ceffa.png" alt="casual-en.png"></p>
<p><a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/">Original pdf</a></p>
<p>#This time, update appropriately</p>
<p>There are many other free books on data science (in English).
Study English before data science</p>
<p>(There are some suspicious things if the formula comes out when you look for it&hellip;)</p>
<p>I would like to summarize if you can introduce youtube version, MOOC version, foreign book limited edition etc.</p>
