      <description>#Introduction  Hello. I am @sho-hata, a new graduate web engineer.
In this article, I read ** a book that I was at the level of index finger typing ** that I had read in a year and a half from when I decided to become a Web engineer! I would like to introduce it without looking back.
We hope that this article will be a stimulus for those who have read it, and we hope that it will be of use to you!</description>
