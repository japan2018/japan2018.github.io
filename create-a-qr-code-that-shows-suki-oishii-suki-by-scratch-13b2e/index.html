</p>
<pre><code>[&quot;Oishiizumi Suki&quot; Advent Calendar](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/ohishi-izumi-suki) I will be in charge of the 5th day.
</code></pre>
<p>This is my first time to join the Advent Calendar. I get excited.</p>
<p>This time, I will introduce the procedure to create a QR code from scratch without depending on the existing library. It is not particularly useful now that the existing libraries are substantial, but please read it as a reading material that feels that QR code is created like this.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-content-of-this-article">About the content of this article</h2>
<p>We will create a QR code that stores the text &ldquo;Suki Oishizumi&rdquo; as data and explain how to read it with an existing QR code reader. The QR code specifications are explained only in the necessary parts.</p>
<h2 id="referenced-site">Referenced site</h2>
<p>First of all, this article is not the original, but a post-challenge challenge based on information from sites that are doing similar things on the web.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.swetake.com/qrcode/qr1.html">Try to make a QR code (http://www.swetake.com/qrcode/qr1.html)</a></p>
<p>In this article, I will focus on the points that are clogged up while referring to this section.</p>
<p>In addition, information on JIS, which is the standard, is essential for implementing the QR code. You can read the specifications (printing is not possible) at <a href="https://www.jisc.go.jp/index.html">JIS site</a>. I can&rsquo;t get the URL to fly directly, so please search the database with &ldquo;JISX0510&rdquo;. The referenced version is &ldquo;X0510: 2018&rdquo; updated in 2018.</p>
<p>I got information from many other sites, so I will introduce it at the end of this article.</p>
<h2 id="decide-the-type-of-qr-code">Decide the type of QR code</h2>
<p>There are actually many types of QR codes, though they are generally referred to as QR codes. There are more than 40 versions, from compact and large grids to very large and detailed ones.</p>
<p>What is different is basically two points, capacity and strength of error correction. The capacity is from 5 bytes to about 3700 bytes, and error correction recovers from 7% to 30% of the total even if part of it cannot be read.</p>
<p>This time, I want to create a simple code that includes the text &ldquo;Suki Oishizumi&rdquo;, so select the small one. Specifically, it is a QR code of 25 squares on each side, called version 2-H. The capacity is 16 bytes (Table 7 on page 31 of the standard manual). In addition, we chose the highest error correction power of 30%.
Enter 9 characters for kanji and hiragana. &ldquo;Anastasia plow&rdquo; is safe. Unfortunately &ldquo;Eve Santa Claus Suki&rdquo; does not enter.</p>
<p>The overall data structure for this version is as follows.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/235258/3312de67-7839-b536-b66f-b9b5f81f1b0b.png" alt="ss01.png">
It looks like this.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/235258/89de6352-4f53-dc1e-d597-52eb3170627b.png" alt="figure-layout.png"></p>
<p>The large eye-catching patterns in the three corners are the &ldquo;position detection pattern&rdquo; (and the adjacent white &ldquo;separation pattern&rdquo;). The pattern that looks like a pedestrian crossing that connects them is the &ldquo;timing pattern&rdquo;, and the small eyeball on the lower right side is the &ldquo;alignment pattern.&rdquo; These are called &ldquo;functional patterns,&rdquo; and they are always fixed in color.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the coding area changes depending on the data to be stored. There are three types below.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Number</th>
<th>Capacity</th>
<th>Details</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>① Data part</td>
<td>128bit</td>
<td>Contains information on the data to be stored and information for identifying its type</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(2) Error correction symbol</td>
<td>224bit</td>
<td>(1), (2) Even if a certain number of parts fail to be read, data can be read correctly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>④ Format information</td>
<td>15bit</td>
<td>Stores information about error correction level and mask. In addition, this information contains error correction information other than ② so that this information itself may be partially omitted.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Other types of QR code may have other &ldquo;model number information&rdquo;, but this time it is not included so it will be omitted. In addition, there are the following parts.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Number</th>
<th>Capacity</th>
<th>Details</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>③ Remaining bit</td>
<td>7bit</td>
<td>The rest of the figure. Fill with bit 0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If you can make these, the QR code is completed. The road is long, but please be patient.</p>
<h2 id="prepare-data-that-can-be-included-in-qr">Prepare data that can be included in QR</h2>
<p>The detailed structure of the data section is as follows.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/235258/6e70129b-b140-2fbc-87a5-66473cf7bafe.png" alt="ss02.png"></p>
<h3 id="mode-type">Mode type</h3>
<p>Since the capacity of the QR code is precious, there are several modes that are specialized for the type of data to enter. This time, select the kanji mode specialized for kanji. Only the characters included in the Shift-JIS character code can be used, but this time this is enough. The identification code for Kanji mode is <code>1000</code> (binary). You can use Unicode strings by using another mode.</p>
<h3 id="word-count">word count</h3>
<p>In kanji mode, the length of the character string is stored in 8 bits. In other modes it is different from being 9 bits or 10 bits. This time it&rsquo;s 5 characters, so it&rsquo;s <code>00000101</code>.</p>
<h3 id="character-data">Character data</h3>
<p>The target character type depends on Shift-JIS (Recently, UTF-8 has become so popular that it has not been used so much&hellip;). In Shift-JIS, one character is represented by 16 bits, but since it is about 7,000 characters in total, it can be represented by 13 bits (2<sup>13</sup>=8096). Follow the procedure below to convert the Shift-JIS character code to a dedicated 13-bit code.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Conditions</th>
<th>Conversion procedure</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>When the character code is in the range of 0x8140 to 0x9FFC<br></td>
<td>1. Subtract 0x8140<br> 2. Add 0xC0 to the upper byte<br> 3. Add the lower byte to the upper byte</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When the character code is in the range of 0xE040 to 0xEBBF<br></td>
<td>1. Subtract 0xC140 <br> 2. Add 0xC0 to the upper byte <br> 3. Add the lower byte to the upper byte</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The reason why the processing is divided into two types is that Shift-JIS itself is largely divided into two sections (strictly four). (<a href="https://opentype.jp/charactercode.htm">Reference</a>)(orStandardsP.89)</p>
<p>As a result, &ldquo;Suki Oishi Izumi&rdquo; is converted as follows.</p>

<h2 id="calculate-error-correction-code-very-painful">Calculate error correction code (very painful)</h2>
<p>This was the hardest part. With the QR code, an error correction code is added by the method called Reed-Solomon code (hereafter RS code) so that the data can be decoded correctly even if part of the data (black or white) cannot be read correctly. This calculation method is very difficult for those who are not good at mathematics.</p>

<h3 id="about-gf2">About GF2</h3>
<p>Before I start the problem, I think I need to explain a mathematical concept called GF(2). I can&rsquo;t explain it easily because it&rsquo;s something I just remembered, but in a nutshell, it means &ldquo;a world with special calculation rules that only has two numbers 0 and 1&rdquo;. In this world, the rules for addition and subtraction are as follows.</p>

<p>Yes, addition and subtraction have exactly the same result. As you can see from this result, this is in agreement with XOR (exclusive OR) of bits. At this point, there are some things that are convenient for computers. By expanding this steadily, various applications will become possible.</p>
<p>By the way, GF is an abbreviation for Galois Field, which is called Galois field or finite field in Japanese.</p>
<h3 id="about-primitive-polynomials-and-gf2sup8sup">About primitive polynomials and GF(2<sup>8</sup>)</h3>
<p>A primitive polynomial is a special polynomial used when expanding and applying GF(p<sup>m</sup>). It is also used when extending GF(2) (p=2,m=1).</p>
<p>GF(2<sup>8</sup>) is an extension of GF(2), which is also a world with special calculation rules. GF(2) contains only two numbers 0 and 1, but GF(2<sup>8</sup>) contains 2<sup>8</sup>=256 numbers .. It seems that it is often used because it is very convenient for 8-bit arithmetic.</p>
<p>When extending GF(2) to GF(2<sup>8</sup>), we use primitive polynomials, but there are several types of primitive polynomials. Since the calculation result changes depending on the usage, x<sup>8</sup>+x<sup>4</sup>+x<sup>3</sup>+x&lt; when creating a QR code You are clearly instructed to use sup&gt;2</sup>+1.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-α">What is α?</h3>
<p>The <code>α</code> that appears in the function G(x) is the primitive polynomial F(x)=x<sup>8</sup>+x<sup>4</sup>+x<sup>3</sup> The root of +x<sup>2</sup>+1, that is, the solution when F(x)=0. And it is a very important entity that constitutes the 256 numbers (also called the original in technical terms) contained in GF(2<sup>8</sup>). Since the property of α is necessary to solve this problem, I will explain it though it is long.</p>
<p>Since α satisfies F(α)=0, the following equation holds.</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">α^8+α^4+α^3+α^2+1 = 0 \tag{1}
</code></pre><p>At this time, all the coefficients of each term belong to the world of GF(2). That is, it takes only two values, 0 and 1, and the result of both addition and subtraction is equal to XOR. Based on that, (1) is transformed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">α^8 = α^4+α^3+α^2+1 \tag{2}
</code></pre><p>You may think it&rsquo;s a little bit, but it&rsquo;s not wrong that there is no minus when you transfer. Since addition and subtraction are the same, it is safe to say that there is no distinction of +/- in this world (α<sup>8</sup>=1α<sup>8</sup>=(0-1)α <sup>8</sup>=-α<sup>8</sup>).</p>
<h3 id="find-the-power-of-α">Find the power of α</h3>
<p>The power of α has a very important property. In order to talk about that, first we will calculate a<sup>e</sup> (e is an integer of 0 or more). α<sup>8</sup> is equal to α<sup>4</sup>+α<sup>3</sup>+α<sup>2</sup>+1, so α<sup>9 </sup>,α<sup>10</sup>,α<sup>11</sup></p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">α^9 = α^5 + α^4 + α^3 + α \\
α^{10} = α^6 + α^5 + α^4 + α^2 \\
α^{11} = α^7 + α^6 + α^5 + α^3 \\
</code></pre><p>It will be For α<sup>12</sup></p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">\begin{align}
α^{12} &amp;= α^8 + α^7 + α^6 + α^4 \\
       &amp;= (a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + 1) + a^7 + a^6 + a^4 \\
       &amp;= a^7 + a^6 + (1+1)a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + 1 \\
       &amp;= a^7 + a^6 + a^3 + a^2 + 1
\end{align}
</code></pre><p>On the third line, the coefficient of α holds 1+1=0, so the term of α<sup>4</sup> disappears. As you may already know, no matter how high the order of α becomes, thanks to the replacement of α<sup>8</sup>, it will be at most 8 terms below α<sup>7</sup>. Can be replaced.</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">α^e = b_1α^7 + b_2α^6 + b_3α^5 + b_4α^4 + b_5α^3 + b_6α^2 + b_7α + b_8
</code></pre><p>b<sub>1</sub>~b<sub>8</sub> are numbers (0 or 1) belonging to GF(2). I feel a bit arithmetic.</p>
<p>And if you increase the order of α all the time,</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">α^{255} = 1
</code></pre><p>Can get Since α<sup>0</sup> = 1, α<sup>e</sup> is designed to loop in 255 cycles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time, but here&rsquo;s the most important thing.</p>
<p>*** For α<sup>e</sup>, the coefficient b<sub>1</sub> to b<sub>8</sub> is uniquely determined in the range of e from 0 to 254** *</p>
<p>In other words, e and b<sub>1</sub>~b<sub>8</sub> can correspond 1:1 each. It should look like the table below.</p>

<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">d = b_1α^7 + b_2α^6 + b_3α^5 + b_4α^4 + b_5α^3 + b_6α^2 + b_7α^1 + b_8
</code></pre><p>Yes, it is the same as the <code>b expression</code> corresponding to α<sup>e</sup>. Therefore, the input data can be converted into the form of d=α<sup>e</sup> every 8 bits. Let&rsquo;s do it for a moment.</p>
<p>The first 4 bytes of data were <code>10000000</code> <code>01010110</code> <code>01010010</code> <code>10101111</code>. Converting this while looking at the correspondence table (obtaining the value of e from the right side to the left side),</p>

d_3 = α^{148} \\
d_4 = α^{97}
</code></pre><p>(Sorry, d<sub>3</sub> and d<sub>4</sub> are not shown due to the omission of the table)</p>
<p>Similarly, it will convert all the data. Just one thing to note. Only when the data is <code>00000000</code>, there is no e that makes α<sup>e</sup>=0. Therefore, give it in the form of α<sup>e</sup> and give the term itself. Will be cut.</p>
<p>As a result, I(x) becomes</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">I(x) = α^{7}x^{15}+α^{219}x^{14}+α^{148}x^{13}+α^{97}x^{12}+α ^{154}x^{11}+α^{167}x^{10}+α^{191}x^9+α^{185}x^8 + \\ α^{223}x^7+ α^{241}x^6+0x^5+α^{122}x^4+α^{100}x^3+α^{122}x^2+α^{100}x+α^{ 122}

</code></pre><p>The pressure is still strong, but it was refreshing.</p>
<p>But how do you find the remainder for a polynomial? I feel like I did it around number II-B when I was in high school. As a reminder, let&rsquo;s find the remainder of dividing the function m(x) = x<sup>2</sup>+3x+1 by g(x)=x-1.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s put the expression on the side that can be broken.</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">x^2 + 3x + 1
</code></pre><p>Then, match the degree and coefficient of the formula on the dividing side to the divided side.</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">\begin{align}
  &amp; x^2 + 3x + 1 \\
- )&amp; x^2-x \hspace{2pc} ← xg(x)
\end{align}
</code></pre><p>And you&rsquo;ll subtract. Eliminate the highest order terms.</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">4x + 1
</code></pre><p>And likewise,</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">\begin{align}
  &amp; 4x + 1 \\
- )&amp; 4x-4 \hspace{2pc} ← 4g(x)
\end{align}
</code></pre><p>It ends here because the remaining ones are below the divisor order. Therefore, the remainder is 5. When the coefficient of the maximum degree of g(x) is 1, it&rsquo;s easy to do like this.</p>
<p>P(x) can be obtained in exactly the same way. Then, I will actually try to divide M(x) by G(x) only at the beginning (sorry, but it is too long to write all).</p>
<p>First, check the terms of the maximum degree of each other. M(x) is α<sup>7</sup>x<sup>43</sup>, G(x) is α<sup>0</sup>x<sup>28</sup>. Therefore, multiply G(x) by α<sup>7</sup>x<sup>15</sup> to match the same value.</p>

\end{align}
</code></pre><p>Equation (3) is used here. Multiplying powers of α is addition of exponents, so</p>

  &amp; α^{7}x^{43}+α^{219}x^{42}+α^{148}x^{41}+... \\

\end{align}
</code></pre><p>Equation (4) is used for this subtraction. The subtraction of exponentiations took an 8-bit XOR. For α<sup>219</sup>-α<sup>175</sup>, α<sup>(01010110 xor 11111111)</sup> = α<sup>10101001</sup> = α<sup>135 </sup> α<sup>148</sup>-α<sup>230</sup> = α<sup>01010010 xor 11110100</sup> = α<sup>10100110</sup> = α<sup>207</sup > &hellip;. Be sure to refer to the table when converting from <code>e expression</code> (exponential value) to <code>b expression</code> (binary number) and when converting from <code>b expression</code> to <code>e expression</code> (as it is decimal &lt; -&gt; No binary conversion is possible)</p>
<p>Now all we have to do is repeat the process of eliminating the highest order terms. Note that after using formula (3), if the exponent becomes 255 or more, use α<sup>255</sup>=1 to correct it so that the exponent becomes less than 255. ..</p>
<p>It ends when the side to be finally divided falls below x<sup>28</sup>, and R(x) is obtained as follows.</p>

<h2 id="place-data-and-error-correction-code-in-a-square">Place data and error correction code in a square</h2>
<p>So far, it is about 60 to 70%. It&rsquo;s almost over.</p>
<p>The created data and error correction symbol will be placed one bit at a time according to the image number. Since 16 bytes of data and 28 bytes of error correction code are used, 44*8=352 bits. Fill up to 351 in the figure.</p>

<p>I will also add color (0 or 1) to the restThe white part is called the bright module and contains <code>bit 0</code>.
The black part is called the dark module and contains <code>bit 1</code>.
The green part is called the residual bit, and since it is a fractional part, insert <code>bit 0</code>.
The purple part is to be entered at the end, but <strong>I did not know what value to set at the moment, so I will put in the <code>value TBD</code>. Please tell me if you are familiar with it</strong>. (The standard (P.45) says that &ldquo;it must be emptied temporarily&rdquo;, but what is empty&hellip;)</p>
<p>Only the purple part of the figure is temporarily placed, but the figure is complete.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-the-right-mask-hard">Choosing the right mask (hard)</h2>
<p>The QR code has a function called &ldquo;mask&rdquo; to prevent patterns that are very difficult to read depending on the content of the data. It is intended to partially invert the placed black and white pattern using eight different patterns to finally generate the pattern that seems to be the most readable.</p>
<p>So, in the software (encoder) that creates the QR code, you have to try all eight masks and select the best one.</p>
<h3 id="mask-type">Mask type</h3>
<p>There are the following 8 types of masks. (Calculation formula is omitted. For details, refer to P.49 of the standard document.)
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/235258/d9ef242d-9388-420b-f058-2d77c531002f.png" alt="masks.png"></p>

<p>After applying each mask, score evaluation is performed according to 4 kinds of evaluation criteria. The evaluation is a deduction system, and the one with the fewest goals is actually used.</p>
<p>The evaluation target is the entire QR code.
(However, there is a part where the color is not decided yet, so it is unclear what to do with it&hellip;)</p>
<p>The evaluation criteria are as follows (Table 11 on page 53 of the standard).</p>

<p>The description here is very rough, so please refer to the standard for the exact contents.</p>
<p>*1 The black 3x3 dark module pattern inside the position detection pattern at the 3 corners will also be deducted (-36 points in total). However, since the mask is not applied to this part, it is deducted equally in the evaluation of all eight masks, so the selection result of the mask is not affected.
*2 Refers to the large position detection pattern in the three corners.</p>
<p>As a result of actual evaluation, only the evaluation 1 and the evaluation 2 were deducted, and the evaluations 3 and 4 were not deducted in all the eight masks. **Regarding Evaluation 3, since the value such as <code>value TBD</code> was put in the format information part, the evaluation stopped working at all, but I wonder what this is&hellip; module Is it appropriate to put in&hellip;?</p>
<p>The mask pattern <code>111</code> (lower right of the image above) was selected with the least goals this time.
Then actually apply the selected mask.</p>
<h2 id="calculate-format-information">Calculate format information</h2>
<p>Fill in the last remaining part. The remaining part is what is called &ldquo;format information&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The following two are included in the format information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Error correction level (2bit) <code>10</code></li>
<li>Selected mask pattern number (3bit) <code>111</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The error correction level is <code>10</code> because&rsquo;H&rsquo; was selected this time. For other levels, refer to the specifications (Table 12 on page 54).</p>
<p>The BCH code is calculated based on this 5-bit information <code>10111</code>. This is also a kind of error correction code similar to RS code. You may think that it&rsquo;s mathematics again, but it&rsquo;s okay because the flow of processing is similar and this one is fairly easy.</p>

<p>By actually experiencing the process of making a QR code, the article &ldquo;<a href="https://qiita.com/amanao/items/b7c54a3c73a8301b2412">Reading the QR code manually</a>&rdquo; that once read and leaned is also &ldquo;Ah, I felt like I could do it somehow.</p>
<p>I hope you will read this article and realize that it is surprisingly easy to create a QR code.</p>
<p>The source code (language is Python) created this time is a little longer, so it is on an external site (Github). Boil it or bake it. (I think it&rsquo;s good to put the QR code on your business card, too.)
