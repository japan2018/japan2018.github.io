<pre><code>## [Introduction]
</code></pre>
<p>This article will be on the 19th day of <a href="https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/machine-learning-01">How I learned machine learning by Nikkei xTECH Business AI ② Advent Calendar 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Here is how my uncle SE studied machine learning.
The motivation was to start with the question, &ldquo;Can you use machine learning?&rdquo;
Since I was working in the dark clouds, my honest memory is vague.</p>
<h3 id="career">career</h3>
<p>I have been programming for nearly 30 years.
Starting with MS BASIC I learned when I was in elementary school, I have touched Z80 assembler, MC68000 assembler, FORTRAN, C (UNIX), C++ (Mac), VB, Java (Android), VB.NET, C#.
I&rsquo;ve been to a lot of different languages, but I&rsquo;ve never been tough enough.</p>
<p>As for machine learning, I worked on neural networks more than 20 years ago, around the end of the so-called secondary AI boom, under the theme of graduation thesis.
However, the logic part was taken care of by another person, and I was in charge of implementation, so I was not sure what it was.
Considering now, I wish I had studied harder at this time, but it is a festival later.
By the way, at that time, there was no machine learning library, so I implemented it in C language.</p>
<h2 id="study-python-winter-2017">[Study Python-Winter 2017]</h2>
<p>I was studying Python by myself before studying machine learning.
I decided to try home monitoring with Raspberry Pi, and used Pyhton to implement it.
However, it was not known in detail as it could be copied and modified.
The following books were referenced at the time.</p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4062579774/">Color illustration: Learn the latest Raspberry Pi to learn how electronic devices work and make them work-Amazon Japan</a></p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi had Python enabled by default, so it was a good place to start, as I didn&rsquo;t know the Python characters.
However, buying a Raspberry Pi just for Python is not practical, so I recommend online learning sites now.
Around me, <a href="https://paiza.jp/works/python3/primer">&ldquo;Paiza Learning&rdquo;</a>and<a href="https://prog-8.com/">&ldquo;Progate&rdquo;</a> were free and well-received. ..</p>
<h2 id="what-is-machine-learning-first-i-bought-a-book-spring-autumn-2017">[&ldquo;What is machine learning?&rdquo; First I bought a book-Spring-Autumn 2017]</h2>
<p>In the classification task I had at the time, I started to feel that there was a limit to implementation with rule base.
Although I had the illusion that AI could do something for me, I didn&rsquo;t get the hang of it, but I learned that machine learning can be implemented using the Python library scikit-learn.
So, I bought the following books that were released at that time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4873117984/">[Machine Learning Beginning with Python-Basics of Feature Engineering and Machine Learning Learned with scikit-learn]-Amazon Japan</a></p>
<p>I bought it just because it contained the letters <code>Python</code> <code>scikit-learn</code> <code>machine learning</code> and because it was an O&rsquo;Reilly book that I have been taking care of for some time.
To be honest, I could only read part of chapters 1 and 2 in Jinpung Kampung.
Here are the lessons learned.</p>
<p>[Chapter 1 Introduction]
・Python grammar
・Existence of various libraries (scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib)
・Iris Dataset</p>
<p>[Chapter 2 Supervised Learning]
・K-nearest neighbor method
・SVM</p>
<h3 id="output-1-application-to-business">Output 1-Application to business</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I understood 10% of the book content at this point.
Even so, I actually implemented it to see if it could be used for the problems I had at the time.
The content was a multi-level classification of data with many parameters.
At that time, it was implemented with a rule base, but I was worried about lack of accuracy.
We were able to empirically visualize and look at the data from a bird&rsquo;s eye view, but we could hardly find regularity in data such as noise, and we felt that it would be impossible to improve accuracy further with rule bases. It was</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/454012/24ce4d2d-d013-6374-5d30-1e0d16f45817.png" alt="image.png">
The above figure is an image of the data we were handling at the time being analyzed.
It was a multilevel classification problem in the state where there were dozens of such data.
Now that we&rsquo;re definitely talking about using machine learning, at that time, the people in the company, including myself, couldn&rsquo;t come up with the idea at all, and desperately tried to implement it based on the rule base.</p>
<p>When I put this data into SVM and k-nearest neighbors, it was classified somehow.
In particular, when hyperparameters were brute-forced by the k-nearest neighbor method, some accuracy was recognized, although the accuracy was slightly lower than that of the rule-based method.
Even though I was struggling with the rule base, I felt the possibility that a model that could classify with reasonable accuracy was completed in just a few minutes of inserting data.</p>
<p>However, I didn&rsquo;t know how to improve the accuracy at that time, and decided that I could not spend more time, so I decided to forgo the adoption of machine learning while feeling the response.</p>
<h4 id="what-you-have-learned">What you have learned</h4>
<ul>
<li>You can now read/write Python code</li>
<li>Data visualization with pandas and matplotlib</li>
<li>A series of data preparation&gt; model definition&gt; fit (learning)&gt; predict (inference) (this flow is the same even if the model changes)</li>
<li>For the first time touching platform, try categorizing irises for the time being</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of results</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, I was hospitalized for a long time at the end of this trial, and reread the O&rsquo;Reilly book in the hospital room.
I was able to read it more than last time, but it didn&rsquo;t come to my mind much because I couldn&rsquo;t code it because I couldn&rsquo;t bring my PC into the hospital room.
After all, I really felt that I had to move my hands to learn.</p>
<h2 id="deep-learning-challenge-spring-summer-2018">[Deep Learning Challenge-Spring-Summer 2018]</h2>
<p>I was away from machine learning for about half a year from the above attempts, but I felt that machine learning was a response, so I decided to try deep learning.
At that time, I did a tutorial of TensorFlow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner"><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/454012/893405f7-62d8-7bb4-a974-a154bc88e16b.png" alt="image.png">
[TensorFlow 2 quickstart for beginners]-Tensorflow</a></p>
<p>The content of the tutorial was a classification problem of MNIST (handwritten numbers), but at that time I could not understand it by directly hitting the API of TensorFlow.
Although I couldn&rsquo;t understand it, I managed to implement iris classification, but I was frustrated because I couldn&rsquo;t get the accuracy at all.</p>
<p>After that, I learned about the existence of Keras, and learned how to classify images by CNN using a sequential model while looking at a sample program.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/examples"><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/454012/8018e4ef-4b16-fe15-69b6-81e9cc427a09.png" alt="image.png">
[Keras-team/keras/examples]-Github</a>
<a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">[Keras-team/keras/examples/mnist_cnn]-Github</a></p>
<p>Currently, the TensorFlow tutorial uses Keras (tf.keras), so I think it&rsquo;s a lot easier.</p>
<p>In addition, I summarized the following article <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> as an article about the know-how that made it possible to use machine learning and TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi and Windows terminals at that time.</p>
<h3 id="get-to-know-google-colaboratory">Get to know Google Colaboratory</h3>
<p>The biggest thing I was studying deep learning was knowing the existence of Google Colaboratory (hereinafter Google Colab).
By using GoogleColab, you can use TensorFlow and Keras just by starting it up, and you can learn at high speed using the GPU for free, so your time resources are reduced at once.</p>
<p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com"><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/454012/6dba7002-5a45-70b9-6342-d609c59e72bd.png" alt="image.png">
[Google Colaboratory]</a></p>
<p>This is a breakthrough, and I think that without Google Colab my machine learning didn&rsquo;t proceed **.
Now that I&rsquo;ve been guided to Google Colab from the TensorFlow tutorial, it&rsquo;s a very useful tool.
Once you have a Google account, you can use it for free, so if you are worried about environment construction and slow processing speed, please use it.</p>
<h3 id="output-2-prototype-image-classification-app">Output 2-Prototype image classification app</h3>
<p>During this period, I repeatedly tried to improve the accuracy of MNIST on Google Colab.
If you think about it now, you can challenge MNIST within Kaggle (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer">Digit Recognizer</a>), so I wish I could join Kaggle earlier. think.</p>
<p>Using the technology acquired in this challenge, I implemented an image classification model that could be used for business, implemented WebAPI (Flask) in Python, and created a simple application that returns the result when throwing an image.
I think the accuracy was about 97.5%.
The figure below is the PoC image I made before making the prototype application.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/454012/dcfc426a-35a8-02b6-481d-49250d24a138.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>After reviewing in-house, it was rejected as &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there are 25 mistakes in 1000 cases&rdquo;.
At that time, AI literacy was low, including me, so I couldn&rsquo;t argue anything&hellip;Also, at this timing, I took on the project to implement in Python.
It was not directly related to machine learning, but since it was a project dealing with a large amount of data in DB and CSV files, I learned various ways to use Pandas here.</p>
<h4 id="what-you-have-learned-1">What you have learned</h4>
<ul>
<li>How to use Github</li>
<li>Keras implementation of CNN</li>
<li>Data Augmentation</li>
<li>How to use Google Colab</li>
<li>Python skill proficiency</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challenge-to-g-test-winter-2019">[Challenge to G-test-Winter 2019]</h2>
<h3 id="output-3-holding-an-in-house-study-session">Output #3-Holding an in-house study session</h3>
<p>Once I knew what CNN was, I became an instructor and held an in-house study session on machine learning and deep learning.
This was also a big turning point.
When the knowledge about machine learning within the company spread to some extent, it became a move to promote machine learning throughout the department.
This led to subsequent actions.</p>
<h3 id="output-4-get-g-test">Output #4-Get G test</h3>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/454012/88763e70-aeab-881b-b096-017a8b9421a0.png" alt="image.png">
We decided to challenge the G test with the members of the study group above.
The books used at that time are as follows.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4798157554/">[Deep Learning Textbook Deep Learning G Test (Generalist) Official Text]</a>
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4049110148/">[AI White Paper 2019]</a></p>
<p>At the same time, multiple employees were required to take the G test, which improved internal AI literacy.
As a result, I have had more opportunities to talk about machine learning topics that I could not talk to anyone in the company, and my stress has been relieved.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t think the G-test can be used in practice, but I think it was very useful for employees to be able to speak using common terms.
After all, I couldn&rsquo;t do it alone, and I felt that I needed to seek out friends and work hard.</p>
<h4 id="what-you-have-learned-2">What you have learned</h4>
<ul>
<li>Reaffirming the importance of output</li>
<li>Machine learning, terms related to AI</li>
<li>Improving in-house AI literacy</li>
<li>Friends with the same purpose (in-house)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="participation-in-hands-on-seminar">[Participation in hands-on seminar]</h2>
<p>After passing the G test, I participated in various free hands-on seminars sponsored by Google and Microsft.
I participated variously, but it didn&rsquo;t have that impact on me at that time.
It may have been unsatisfactory at the seminar for beginners.</p>
<h3 id="participation-in-long-term-seminar-spring-autumn-2019">Participation in long-term seminar-Spring-Autumn 2019</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, I had the opportunity to attend a half-year long-term seminar.
At that time, the following videos were provided as pre-learning videos.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/kikagaku_blackbox_1/">[[Kikagaku Style] Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Deblack Box Course -Beginners-]- Udemy</a>
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/kikagaku_blackbox_2/">[[Kikagaku Style] Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Deblack Box Course-Intermediate Level -]- Udemy</a></p>
<p>By watching this video, I was able to dig deeper into machine learning, which I used to use in the way I knew.</p>
<p>I will skip about the long-term seminar because it will be miso, but it was a difficult experience to work with other students for half a year as well as the content of the seminar.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/454012/e7bd5ec5-3d20-4f67-17b1-a90adca4864b.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<h3 id="output-5-student-mentoring">Output #5-Student Mentoring</h3>
<p>I participated in the above seminar as a student and provided domain knowledge and technical support to the instructor.
In the latter half of the seminar, the training was the main course, so I participated as a mentor, not as a student.
I don&rsquo;t know if it was successful at the first opportunity, but I think it was a good place for self-study.</p>
<h4 id="what-you-have-learned-3">What you have learned</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mathematical mechanism of machine learning and deep learning</li>
<li>Familiarity with data preprocessing</li>
<li>Hyper parameter tuning</li>
<li>Generated model</li>
<li>Function API</li>
<li>Friends with the same purpose (outside)</li>
</ul>
<p>##【from now on】</p>
<h3 id="output-6-formation-of-a-community-such-as-mokumokukai">Output #6-Formation of a community such as Mokumokukai</h3>
<p>Currently, we are holding a &ldquo;Mokumoku-kai&rdquo; for machine learning.
Initially it was for internal use, but we are supporting the people who are trying new machine learning while making it a place for seminar participants and graduates to gather.
I will also be involved in <a href="https://dllab.connpass.com/">[DEEP LEARNING LAB]</a>, so I will be actively involved in that as well.</p>
<p>Even in a small area, I would like to form a community where people can connect through machine learning and AI to reduce the number of people who bother and give up alone.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/454012/cfdd478a-10a2-fe13-4f32-eeb693e74cce.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<h2 id="summary">[Summary]</h2>
<h3 id="anyway-move-your-hands">Anyway, move your hands</h3>
<p>I wrote a lot, but there is definitely something I can say.
That means that it stretches most when you move your hands.
Even if you read a book or article on the Web and it sounds like it, when you actually try to move it, it stumbles.
I think you can understand deeply when you actually move what is written.
If possible, it&rsquo;s best to think and implement it yourself, rather than copy and paste the code.
Of the ten, I will stumble at the time of mounting.
You&rsquo;ll learn that you faced various challenges during implementation and overcame them.</p>
<h3 id="dataset-initiatives">Dataset Initiatives</h3>
<p>Even if you try to move your hand anyway, even if you try using existing datasets such as Iris and MNIST, the expected value for skill improvement is low.
The famous Titanic datasets, etc. are also good to use as a tutorial, but honestly, these datasets do not increase motivation, so I can not really tackle them.
When you try to manage the data related to what you want to do, such as actual business tasks, you will come across various problems and take action to solve them as skills.</p>
<p>Even if you are not directly connected to your work, it is also a good idea to search for a dataset of your interest ** and work on it ** using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> etc.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are interested in the dataset or the prize, but if you don&rsquo;t get motivated anyway, you&rsquo;ll quickly compromise when you run into problems.
In the case of Kaggle, the result is directly linked to the rank, so the result is easy to understand, and it is recommended because you can compare it with your own method while looking at the code of people with high rank.</p>
<h3 id="find-someone-to-talk-to">Find someone to talk to</h3>
<p>The hardest thing about working on the unknown area of machine learning was that there was no one to talk to.
It&rsquo;s not good mentally to work on your own when you&rsquo;re stuck.
Many of the people I met at the seminar also received various consultations, saying that <strong>there is no one to talk to in-house</strong>.
I will guide you to the solution while listening to the story, those who solve it while discussing each other, those who solve it while talking, bring colleagues to the &ldquo;Mokumokukai&rdquo; and increase the number of friends in the company and solve together There were various people such as those who did.
In any case, talking to others tends to approach problem solving.
Speaking is a kind of output, so I think it&rsquo;s very important to talk in terms of keeping your mind organized.
Ideally, you should find someone you can talk to in real time, not only in the company but also at events such as seminars and Mokumokukai.
Even if it is not, I think that it is also possible to interact online such as Kaggle&rsquo;s forum.</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">【in conclusion&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Japan is still immature when it comes to machine learning and AI.
Most of the information is in English, and there are many scenes where you hit a wall without finding the information you are looking for.
Do not worry alone at such times.
If you are worried, you can be your boss or a colleague, so let&rsquo;s involve others.
If you&rsquo;re not around, look further out.
There are many people in the world who are equally suffering.
You can quickly find people with the same circumstances in the online society.
I will continue to study so that I can help you, so let&rsquo;s do our best together.</p>
