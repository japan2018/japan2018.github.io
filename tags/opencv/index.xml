      <description>#Overview  Recently, I learned image processing in a class and learned the technique of transforming a plane by matrix transformation.
Then I suddenly got an urge to make the Leaning Tower of Pisa vertical, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to practice Python and OpenCV.
Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t understand much, so I&amp;rsquo;m good at using OpenCV useful functions.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Vertical!
#environment windows10 Python 3.7.7 OpenCV 3.4.2 Pillow 7.1.2 numpy 1.18.4
#Implementation Click here for the Leaning Tower of Pisa Since white is strong as a whole, this time try to detect the contour not by the edge but by the color tone.</description>

 Display the recorded video and time on the screen If someone comes in front of the entrance, record a still image in jpeg format Embed the shooting time in the recorded still image Allow some false positives  *By the way, we have already obtained permission to install the camera.</description>

      <description>* In the past, we did LT about photogrammetry and OpenCV with [xRTechNagoya](https://vrm-nagoya.connpass.com/event/162233/)and[XRMTG](https://togetter.com/li/1470739) It is almost the same as the one.  About this document Photogrammetry that can create 3D data from multiple photos. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to generate data without any special equipment&amp;hellip; If you use 3DF Zephyr for photogrammetry, you may be able to take it neatly like a tree trunk, or it may be something awful like a pillar.</description>

      <description>After seeing the OpenCV site for the first time in a while, it was new, so I tried it a little.  https://opencv.org/
I used to track baseball balls in Java a long time ago, so this time I tried using Python. Tracking is performed by combining background difference and template matching.
Environment The environment is as follows.

      <description>I got Razpai 3B+ and picamera because of university class. Since I&#39;m free, I decided to let Razpai classify using deep learning. However, instead of classifying the pictures taken in advance, it classifies the objects in the real-time image from picamera and displays them in a nice way.  It may be at the student level, but I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate it if you can refer to even a part of it.</description>

      <description>Hello. This is my first post.  The other day, when I went to Saizeriya, the waiting time was about 20 minutes, and I was looking for a mistake in Saizeriya, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it&amp;hellip; So I thought I could solve it with image processing, so I tried it. It was also a good study of OpenCV.

I am working in the manufacturing industry, but I feel the flow of actively introducing IoT and AI technologies. I do not belong to the system department that mainly handles these technologies. However, I want to feel the flow myself! I think. There is a Raspberry Pi as a tool that is relatively easy to handle, so I am tentatively planning what can be done with this.</description>

      <description>#Execution environment  Ubuntu 18.04 Python 3.6.9 OpenCV 3.3.0 #Overview When processing a large number of images, there are a mixture of bright and dark photos, It also affects the processing result, so I want to make the brightness uniform!
From that thought, Since I had the opportunity to adjust the brightness of the image in the preprocessing of learning, I will summarize the method. The purpose is to normalize the input color image to a uniform brightness.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  I often use OpenCV feature point extraction and matching, When using multiple images, feature point extraction often took time. Therefore, this time, I made a program that outputs feature point information to a file and uses it for matching.
As an example, let&amp;rsquo;s find the girl with red glasses (target image) from the girls (12 source images) this time!

You can also hide the estimation line.
The coordinates of the joint are acquired using OpenPose, the angle is calculated from that, and it is judged whether the pose looks like that.
About OpenPose How to set up I used tf pose estimation which is Tensorflow version of OpenPose. My environment was Windows10, GTX1070, etc., so I referred to the following page for setup.</description>

      <description>Edge refers to the boundary between objects and the background, and edge detection generally refers to image processing that detects edges by detecting changes in pixel values and large brightness gradients in the image.  (Image is from [Free Image Site](https://www.pakutaso.com/20191228360post-24995.html)) What is cv2.Canny() Edge detection function implemented/provided by opencv. Although edge images can be created easily, (mainly) two parameters need to be adjusted for proper use.

      <description>Do you all know Wear?  WEAR is a fashion coordination site and one of our services. In short, it is an SNS where you can share your fashion coordination.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but it seems to be popular to post with the face hidden by an icon. Is it because people without a face can see the coordination objectively?
However, the face hiding work is surprisingly troublesome, and I wish I could automate this&amp;hellip; so I implemented a program for automatic icon placement.</description>

It was a year-end and New Year holiday, so I made a little classifier using a neural network. If you google it, a lot of images of the two people will appear, so it was good for CNN, but This time, as another approach, I would like to perform classification based on the position of landmarks on the face.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  Hello, My name is Kano. At ABEJA, I am in charge of customer support for Insight for Retail, a retail service.
Recently, I am living a vegan life under the influence of a documentary called Game Changer that I watched on Netflix. However, I sometimes eat Jiro, family, or cottery ramen, so I can&amp;rsquo;t lose weight.
I&amp;rsquo;m not an engineer, but I will do my best to write it.</description>

      <description>This article is the 15th day article of [Kinki University Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/kindai).  In this article, I will write about object detection roughly. It is written with reference to the contents of the survey paper &amp;ldquo;Object Detection in 20 Years: A Survey&amp;rdquo;.
1. What is Object Detection? Object detection is the task of detecting instances of classes and semantic objects in images and videos. In the old days, it was a difficult task to get accuracy because there are two kinds of guidelines, classify and semantic.</description>

background My only hobby other than programming is guitar, but I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of creating a service that makes it easy to search the guitar from the outside. In the process, it seems that I will need an image of the guitar alone, so I was looking for a way to remove the background.</description>

In the sample code, the sending side sends images taken from the webcam to the server at regular intervals, the receiving side detects faces and draws a box, and then saves the image file locally.</description>

      <description>#Head direction estimation?  Head direction estimation, or Head Pose Estimation in English. It is an algorithm that estimates the direction of the face and the inclination of the head from the input image information and facial feature amount data. Recently, it is widely used for Vtuber development.
Head direction estimation method Qiita has already introduced several methods for estimating the head direction. This is very well summarized in the Qiita article.</description>

So I would like to actually try it. If you would like to implement it for the time being, please read from &amp;ldquo;Easy face landmark detection&amp;rdquo;.
About face landmark detection method It seems that there are three main methods for detecting face landmarks.</description>

Although it is possible to get the character and the position with considerable accuracy by extracting the character with the google cloud vision API, I will try to get the character by other methods here.

I&amp;rsquo;m developing an app for iOS called Goki Box. As one of its functions, we have incorporated a function that images the Othello board with a camera and overlays the evaluation value on the board with AR.</description>

      <description>The articles about OpenCV and Raspberry Pi, which I wrote a long time ago, have started to be read by everyone again recently. I think that you are referring to it because it is a keyword related to the recent trends of &amp;quot;deep learning&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;edge computing&amp;quot;. When I suddenly think about the scenes where edge computing is used, I feel that I often see cases of motion detection with cameras.</description>
