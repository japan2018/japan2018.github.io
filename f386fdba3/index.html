<p>#Introduction (Introduction)
There are many technical blogs with titles such as &ldquo;for beginners ~&rdquo; and &ldquo;~~ introduction&rdquo;, but I often feel that most of them are written for people who know to some extent. Is it a feeling that people who know the technology organize and write information as a review? There are articles that exhausted on the way and memos that you should know.
I think it&rsquo;s unavoidable that people who do not understand understand &ldquo;I do not understand&rdquo;, but even in articles that assume beginners, it is clear about &ldquo;necessary as an engineer&rdquo; and &ldquo;setting up necessary to use that system&rdquo; There are many things that I do not mention, and for beginners there are many situations where ** &ldquo;I am doing what I was told I can not do it!!&rdquo; **.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a non-programmer construction consultant, and I thought &ldquo;I want to use GeoDjango to make an app&rdquo;, but before I was a <strong>completely web-related beginner</strong>, the ability to read this omitted branch was omitted. The ability to perform the work stood up as a high wall.
#Purpose
Based on this experience, this paper aims to provide supplementary teaching materials for GeoDjango tutorials to web application development beginners and non-programmers.</p>

<p>###Development environment
macOS version 10.15.1</p>
<p>#Practice! !
###0. Be prepared for programming
I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s familiar to non-programmers, and I don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to see it as &ldquo;unusual&rdquo; attitude for programmers and unexpectedly collected information. Here are some of the grateful attitudes that the acquaintances of the programmer taught me.</p>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;Please refer to the official document as well as the technical blog&rdquo;</em></strong>
Learning a computer language is equivalent to learning a new language, and it is important to have a firm understanding of grammar. It is very important to go back to the basics and have enough time to read the official document.
<strong><em>&ldquo;Please read the Error sentence properly before searching&rdquo;</em></strong>
There was an error, and I was &ldquo;wowed&rdquo; and asked Google Sensei without even reading the error statement, which was a waste of time. Python has the exact cause of the error at the end of the error statement. Stay calm and read the Error statement.
**<em>&ldquo;Most of the problems you hit are problems that someone has already hit&rdquo;__
If you have a problem, before you ask anyone, please search various technical blogs such as Qiita and StackOverFlow for people who are having the same problem. There are overwhelmingly more English sources than Japanese sources, and boldly challenging English is a shortcut to solving problems.
**</em>&ldquo;It is justice that the script works. Justice that can serve the purpose.&quot;__
When I read a CSV file as a dataframe, I found that using pandas could be done in an instant, but I was wondering if I could manage it with numpy&rsquo;s np.loadtxt. My feeling was that I was suffering from the &ldquo;illness I want to do after all the things are finished&rdquo; that is common to beginners who say, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it because I don&rsquo;t have a good understanding of numpy, I have to master it properly&hellip;&rdquo;. When I consulted with a friend&rsquo;s programmer, he said, &ldquo;Put that purpose to the highest priority. It&rsquo;s fine with pandas because it&rsquo;s a waste of time.&rdquo; We are not in the test. There&rsquo;s smart code, but there&rsquo;s no right answer, so don&rsquo;t miss the top priority: &ldquo;Fulfill your goals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>###1. Prior learning
####1-1. Learn the basic operations of Django
The original <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/ja/3.0/intro/tutorial01//%22CreateyourfirstDjangoapplication%22">Django Tutorial</a>isdifficultforbeginners,so<a href="https://tutorial.LearnthebasicsofDjangoatdjangogirls.org/en/%22DjangoGirlsTutrial%22">DjangoGirlsTutorial</a>.Itcoverstheminimumrequiredcommandlineoperations,HTML,CSS,andPythonbasicgrammarnecessaryforDjangooperation,soyoudonotneedtolearnelementaltechnologyindividually.However,sinceitisaminimum,itissummarizedin<a href="basicknowledgeabout#webandbasicgrammarofpython">Lower</a> for studying methods to deepen these elemental technologies individually.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As I became aware of the flow of some &ldquo;one set&rdquo; such as &ldquo;,&rdquo; understanding has progressed.</p>
<p>####1-2. Learn PostgreSQL operation using DOCKER
<a href="https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/%22DjangoGirlsTutrial%22">DjangoGirls Tutorial</a> uses the default database (SQLite), but GeoDjango needs to change this to PostgreSQL.
[Geospatial information started with GeoDjango](<a href="https://homata.gitbook.io/geodjango/geodjango/install#postgisnodtabsuwo">https://homata.gitbook.io/geodjango/geodjango/install#postgisnodtabsuwo</a> / &ldquo;Create PostGIS database&rdquo;) uses PostGIS, which is the location information extension of PostgreSQL, by <code>$ createdb</code> command. I&rsquo;m creating a database for, but if that doesn&rsquo;t work you should use DOCKER. Creating and starting a database using DOCKER is <a href="https://realpython.com/location-based-app-with-geodjango-tutorial/%22MakeaLocation-BasedWebAppWithDjangoandGeoDjango%22">Make a Location-Based Web App With Django and GeoDjango</a>.
On the other hand, the installation method using Homebrew of four peripheral tools required for GeoDjango (GDAL, GEOS, PROJ4, PostgresSQL) is not introduced on this site, so <a href="YouneedtoinstallHomebrewandinstallthetoolsbyreferringtohttps://homata.gitbook.io/geodjango/qian-zhun-bei/install#mac-osx-1/%22Mac(OSX)%22">Geospatial information starting with GeoDjango: preparation installation</a>.
This is the Xcode installation required when installing Homebrew, but there was a problem with the installation from the Appstore, so [this article](<a href="https://qiita.com/NolikaOhkawa/items/1bc2960f513d3d6a8882">https://qiita.com/NolikaOhkawa/items/1bc2960f513d3d6a8882</a> / &ldquo;Install Xcode on the Mac. I installed it directly from the .dmg file.</p>
<p>###2.GeoDjango Tutorial
If you have done enough preliminary learning up to this point, you will be able to clear GeoDjango Tutorial: <a href="https://homata.gitbook.io/geodjango/%22GeospatialInformationStartingwithGeoDjango%22">Geospatial Information Starting with GeoDjango</a> at Explosive Speed.</p>
<p>As I went through the tutorial while referring to multiple sites, I was often confused by the difference in code notation. The notation varies depending on the person/site,</p>
<pre><code class="language-terminal:" data-lang="terminal:">Which shows the memo,
(env) $ which shows the description in terminal,
Which shows the execution result in terminal

By the way, where is the editor
Does it indicate a script that should be edited
</code></pre><p>It took me some time to understand. For example, for the code shown in <a href="https://homata.gitbook.io/geodjango/geodjango/tutorial#restful-apino/%22GeoDjangoTutorial:CreatingaRESTfulAPI%22">&ldquo;Creating a RESTful API&rdquo;</a>If<code>(env)$</code>isatthebeginningofasentence,youcantellthatitiswritteninterminal,butitisnecessarytoreadthecontextwhetherthegroundpartistheexecutionresultofterminalorthecodeinthefile.Aroundhere,itis&quot;naturalforthosewhounderstand&rdquo;,butIthinkthatittakessometimeforbeginnerstogetusedtoit.<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/304391/1ca9a958-4e34-8df6-f1bd-f16c960abd7c.jpeg" alt="Image24-12-19at2.52am.JPG">

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In order to develop apps at the explosive speed, the accumulated learning to acquire the knowledge is indispensable. In this learning, it is important that there is someone who can not come across resources that can reach the itchy point and that many of the clues to the solution came from the mouth of the person, and to learn with someone again and consult with him. I realized that.</p>
<p>##Supplementary information</p>
<h3 id="basic-knowledge-about-web-and-basic-python-grammar">Basic knowledge about WEB and basic Python grammar</h3>
<p>To use Django, you need basic knowledge of website construction and you need to know the basic grammar of Python, so beginners should take the following materials one by one. You don&rsquo;t have to memorize it because you only need to know the concept. __ Monthly fee of 1000 yen Please concentrate and finish in a short period of time. __
You can use commercially available text, but I personally recommend Dot Install Progate. Although I used it myself, I think that these two sites are conscientious learning support services that do not advertise using words such as &ldquo;job change&rdquo; &ldquo;employment&rdquo; etc. is.</p>
