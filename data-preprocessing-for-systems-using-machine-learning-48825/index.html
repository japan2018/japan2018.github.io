<p>#Outline and flow of AI projects
Data analysis utilizing AI technology such as machine learning is drawing attention, and the number of projects utilizing AI is increasing. In AI projects, by analyzing customer data, we create machine learning models to gain some insight and automate forecasts.
In many cases of AI projects, 1) data scientists who are experts in data analysis play a central role in conducting PoC (Proof of Concept) to confirm the usefulness of data analysis and machine learning models. It will be implemented in two stages, in which a system engineer (SE) will put it into a production system. The PoC deliverables by the data scientists include the source code written in languages such as Python in addition to the report submitted to the customer, and SE designs and systemizes based on this.</p>
<h1 id="challenges-in-systemization">Challenges in systemization</h1>
<p>One of the challenges of systematization based on PoC deliverables is the increase of data volume in production environment. Since PoC is just verification, the amount of data entrusted to us by the customer is often small, and we often sample and use the data for quick verification even when there is a large amount of data. As such, PoCs typically use small amounts of data that can be processed on a single desktop machine. On the other hand, since machine learning systems perform learning based on data, they have the characteristic that the prediction accuracy increases as the amount of data increases. Therefore, a large amount of data is often used in order to improve the prediction accuracy when making it into a production system, and a machine learning system is required to have high data processing performance.</p>
<p>In addition, while the machine learning model is handled by the data scientist, the data pre-processing is generally designed by engineers such as SEs. Data preprocessing is a technology that is closely related to the model of machine learning, but it also requires knowledge as SE such as basic design, sizing, and failure handling at the time of failure.
At that time, it is not efficient for the SE side to redesign and re-implement the preprocessing from the beginning with cost and time. Therefore, the approach of systematization using a prototype developed by data scientists in Python etc. is effective. However, there is currently not much public information available on such design know-how.
In this post, we will introduce the design procedure and points of data preprocessing based on the knowledge obtained from the results of performance verification, targeting SEs who have completed the PoC stage and are designing systems incorporating machine learning models. I will.</p>
<p>#Outline of data preprocessing in machine learning system</p>
<h2 id="data-preprocessing-in-machine-learning-system">Data preprocessing in machine learning system</h2>
<p>In a system that uses machine learning, it is possible to perform data preprocessing mainly in three phases: learning, inference, and retraining. Figure 1 shows the outline.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/585266/3ff9d6d8-d6a4-7e2e-15f1-208d809b5aa8.png" alt="Outline of pre-processing system"><br>

<p>Data preprocessing during learning</p>
<p>Data sets stored in various formats are transformed into a data structure suitable for learning a model, and data normalization and aggregation are performed to improve accuracy. In the pre-processing at the time of learning, there are many cases where all data are processed in a batch, and the processing amount tends to be much larger than that at the time of inference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data preprocessing during inference</p>
<p>Inference uses models to perform classification and trend predictions on data collected from real-world operations. Inference can also impose latency requirements, such as seconds, which also impose latency requirements on preprocessing.
The data preprocessing at the time of inference is a process that performs conversion so that it has the same feature amount as at the time of learning, but it is performed only on the data to be inferred, and the process may be simplified. On the other hand, since it is necessary to execute the process each time the model is used, it is frequently called continuously in the production system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data preprocessing during retraining</p>
<p>If data that can be diverted to learning is accumulated based on actual data at the operation site, it may be used to update the model. In such a case, the same processing as the data preprocessing during learning will be performed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="issues-and-solution-policies-in-data-preprocessing-design">Issues and solution policies in data preprocessing design</h2>
<p>Since data scientists often perform PoC with a small amount of data, preprocessing is often implemented in Python during PoC. On the other hand, if you try to implement preprocessing in Python during systemization, the problems shown in Table 1 below will occur. Table 1 also shows the proposed solution to the problem.</p>

<h3 id="resource-estimation">Resource estimation</h3>
<p>In the learning system, the most important point is whether the model development using the target data can be completed within the period required by the system requirements. In the PoC phase, the target data is often handled by focusing on a part of the target (devices, forms, etc.) for a part of the period, but in the subsequent systemization, the whole period and all types of data are handled. This can lead to huge amounts of data. For pre-processing, it is important to estimate the resources (number of CPUs, memory amount) required in systematization design so that processing can be completed within an acceptable processing time for large data.</p>
<p>When determining the resources required for preprocessing, first check the input/output data size and processing time using a small data set for each processing in the preprocessing. Also, check the processing (processing with a large number of iterations) that can be expected to be effective in optimizing the processing logic, which will be described in the second and subsequent sections.</p>
<p>Regarding the number of CPUs among the resources, estimate the processing time of the production system from the input data size of the production system based on the input data size and the processing time when using a small data set (at this time, the processing time is the data It shall be proportional to the size). By dividing this time by the processing time defined in your system requirements, you can estimate the approximate number of CPUs you will need.</p>
<p>For the memory size, estimate the data size of each process in the production system based on the input data size of each process when using a small data set, and estimate the total size.</p>
<h3 id="selection-of-data-processing-infrastructure">Selection of data processing infrastructure</h3>
<p>As a base for pre-processing the data of the production pre-processing system, it is possible to determine whether to build an environment in which PoC code written in Python is executed as it is or to execute it on a distributed processing platform such as Spark. Is required.
Basically, as a result of estimating the required resources, if the memory seems to be insufficient, Spark will be preprocessed, and if the memory amount is not a problem, Python will be preprocessed as it is.</p>
