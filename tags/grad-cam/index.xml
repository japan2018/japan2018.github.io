      <description>#Introduction  Grad-CAM is a good way to visualize where the model looks and discriminates. However, as a personal complaint, Grad-CAM has a low resolution of (14,14) for the image size (224,224). The reason why the resolution of Grad-CAM is low is that pooling is included 4 times in VGG16 model. However, except for the pooling layer, only the short-distance features of the image can be extracted, and the long-distance features cannot be extracted.</description>
