      <description># Even in 2020, I am alive with worry about memory  8GB laptop, VS Code + some build + Chrome with 20 tabs open ** I run out of memory in no time **. It is a very strict user experience such as stall for each OS.
When I think about it, there were many times when I was a child ** I was scolded by my mother if I left things out.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Recently, I started using the Python language processing tool &amp;ldquo;GiNZA&amp;rdquo;. I used to use MeCab so far, but I recently (shyly) found out that Python has a library that incorporates state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, so I&amp;rsquo;m currently moving to GiNZA. This time it is the first GiNZA, so I tried to summarize the processing flow as a memorandum while referring to various sites. There are many places that I am new to natural language analysis and I can not reach it, so please refer to the official documents etc.</description>
