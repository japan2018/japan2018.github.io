      <description># 1.First of all  This article is the 24th day article of Yuyuki AdventCalender 2019.
2. What you want to do  I want to go to the world of Yuyu â†’ I want to convert a facial photograph into a Yuyu style  Last year at Advent Calender, I tried automatic coloring of black and white cartoons with CycleGAN. (Trying to colorize manga in CycleGAN ~Yuyu ceremony~)) CycleGAN is good at style conversion such as changing colors and textures, but it is not good at shape conversion.</description>
