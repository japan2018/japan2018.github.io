      <description># Target audience  It is a continuation of Last article. This article prepares for coding from now on. If you want to implement it yourself, but it is quite &amp;hellip; please take a look. (Basically, I can&amp;rsquo;t use complicated techniques, so don&amp;rsquo;t worry.) ** The coding environment is jupyter notebook. ** If you want to manage it at the module level elsewhere, uncomment the command such as import. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work please let me know in the comments&amp;hellip; Next article here</description>

      <description>#Let&#39;s study by this time  There are many generous organizations overseas, or there are many specialized books that can be read for free.
There are other summary articles of this series, I would like to display translated Japanese books and original books side by side. Especially introduced only in the field of data science.
Maybe that expensive original book is actually free?

      <description>**The video used in this article was recorded a long time ago, and I currently refrain from exercising at the gym. **  #Introduction This is the second edition of &amp;ldquo;Muscle Training x Deep Learning&amp;rdquo;. The first is here (Deep learning made it easier to see the time-lapse of physical changes). &amp;ldquo;Form check&amp;rdquo; that many trainees (people who love muscle training) have become habitual. You can fix your smartphone during the training, take a selfie, and look back later to know the habit of your form and improve the quality of your training afterwards!</description>

      <description>#What is neural style conversion?  Neural style conversion is one of the machine learning techniques that transforms a target image into the style (texture) of another image to generate a new image. It&amp;rsquo;s a technology used in apps that change Van Gogh&amp;rsquo;s image of a city or people. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s try using this technology to see if this time we can transform a real, ferocious crocodile image that seems to eat humans into a gentle crocodile crocodile by transforming its style into a crocodile style that will die 100 days later.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s blissful to take a picture of your pumped body after training and look back later. In addition, if you display the captured image in animation like a time lapse, you can understand that muscle growth is more like a hand!

      <guid>https://memotut.com/why-deep-metric-learning-based-on-the-softmax-function-works-7ed56/</guid>
      <description>#Introduction  In distance learning (metric learning) using deep learning, similarities (and dissimilarities) between images are used by using Contrastive Loss and Triplet Loss.) Is widely used, but it is also known that it is difficult to combine and select learning data, and learning itself is difficult in many cases. For that reason, various improvements and ideas have been proposed so far. However, recently, metric learning, which can learn based on the Softmax function as if it is a general class classification task without the difficulty of selecting learning data like this, has been attracting attention.</description>

      <description>I resumed learning Python last December 3rd. I was wondering if I could make something for practice, but I came up with the idea of creating an AI for stock price forecasting, so I decided to give it a try. As a result, we have AI that can predict (and possibly even predict) that stock prices will rise or fall by more than 1% with 64% accuracy. Project 1 is the main subject because of the process of getting into the main subject of Project 1.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with SinGAN a lot lately, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to summarize the results. SinGAN is a paper that became a hot topic because it was selected as the best paper at ICCV 2019. It&amp;rsquo;s great for learning with just one image and generating images of any size with the same features. ![Screenshot from 2019-12-24 18-23-29.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone.  I started Qiita from today.
As a machine learning engineer, I am usually involved in AI development and web application development.
In private, I became a newbie daddy. I am writing an article while holding my eldest son who will be 4 months (laugh)
As a motivation to write an article, I have been working on machine learning since 2017 when there was no reference book yet, I always feel that the experience of having a hard time learning machine learning is useful for someone.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  This article is an entry of CyberAgent20 new graduate engineer Advent Calender 2019 on the 18th day. I am a graduate student doing computer vision research using deep learning. twitter → https://twitter.com/revi_matsu This time, it is SinGAN practice that won the best paper at ICCV2019 held the other day.
How to read this article [For those who want a rough overview] Read this article. [For those who want to know the specifications a little] This article →I briefly read &amp;ldquo;SinGAN&amp;rdquo; and summarized it [For those who want to know the details] This article → &amp;ldquo;SinGAN&amp;rdquo; I read it briefly and summarized it→Papers</description>

      <description># Target of this article  Purpose of writing the article The words AI and deep learning have been around for a long time, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think there are many people who really understand their meaning. I think it&amp;rsquo;s very dangerous to have a debate about what AI can do, as in Japan today.
I think the reason why there is such a debate about AI in this way is that you do not fully understand the mathematical basis of machine learning.</description>

      <description># Now, the beginning of the mystery solving  Original article: With a deep learning, the recovery rate can exceed 100% in horse racing
First try to move I will purchase the program and try it. As described in the explanation, basically it worked with copy and paste, but the following two places did not work as they are, so I fixed it here.
 Parsing date data Column names of features used for learning and inference  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look exactly the same because it contains random elements, but the graphs also moved in roughly the same way, so it seems to have been reproduced.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I was told that &amp;ldquo;AI takes away human work&amp;rdquo; **, but now some people say that &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m in a period of disillusionment&amp;rdquo; **. Thanks to that, I was not robbed of my work, and I am swayed by a crowded train every day. The scams that rob you are also a good thing.
While the development of such AI seems to take a little longer, it is now easy to obtain an environment for learning.</description>

      <description>We at Team AI hold machine learning study sessions and data analysis hackathons every day in Shibuya.  The goal is to have a community of 1 million people, mainly in Tokyo.
I hope this movement of data analysis will spread throughout Japan and around the world. We have put together a useful tutorial for doing data analysis hackathons. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fun, so everyone, especially the locals, should try it out for yourself!</description>

      <description>Deep learning has become a hot topic these days,  &amp;ldquo;I want to study, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what I can do&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
For such people, we will introduce the methods from Mac environment construction to deep learning execution.
python environment construction Machine learning and deep learning are python. For the time being, prepare the environment construction of python. First, let&amp;rsquo;s install python. Let&amp;rsquo;s open the terminal and run it in order.</description>
