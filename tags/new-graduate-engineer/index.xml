      <description>#Introduction  Hello. I am @sho-hata, a new graduate web engineer.
In this article, I read ** a book that I was at the level of index finger typing ** that I had read in a year and a half from when I decided to become a Web engineer! I would like to introduce it without looking back.
We hope that this article will be a stimulus for those who have read it, and we hope that it will be of use to you!</description>

      <description>This article is about how I learned machine learning by Nikkei xTECH Business AIâ‘¡ Advent Calendar 2019 __.  Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the steps that have taken a slightly different step from the general approach to learning machine learning. I would be happy if it could be used as a reference for as many people as possible. I usually write for individual blogs, and I was warmly thinking about writing on my blog, but I thought it was a great opportunity, so I posted it on __qiita for the first time __.</description>
