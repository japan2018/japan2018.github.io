<pre><code>It is called business automation, but there are many tools for automation. You mean, &quot;You don't have to use that special tool for that task!?&quot; So, I tried to categorize by business type, environment, user type, etc.
</code></pre>
<h1 id="1-automation-of-core-operations-accounting-hr-crm-erp-etc">1. Automation of core operations (accounting, HR, CRM, ERP, etc.)</h1>
<p>RPA recommendation level: ☆☆☆☆☆</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hesitate to introduce packaged software for human resources, salary, management accounting, supply chain, cost accounting, CRM, etc. for basic business as a company independent of the industry and automation of business unique to the industry. .. If your company is a startup just starting up, you may manage various things with Excel for the first year or so, but this part is for decades rather than inventing yourself It doesn&rsquo;t match the package that I have made. Recently, free SaaS services are coming out, so I don&rsquo;t recommend automating them yourself or building them from scratch. With packages, you often don&rsquo;t have to have highly knowledgeable engineers in your organization to handle the software.</p>
<p>By the way, there are occasions where RPA plays an active role when connecting these business systems to other systems or inputting data.</p>
<h1 id="2-automation-of-office-software-alone">2. Automation of Office software alone</h1>
<p>RPA recommendation level: ⭐⭐☆☆☆</p>
<p>When you use Office software to automate your work, such as reading data from a file on an Excel file and calculating accounting, reading data into PowerPoint or Word and outputting it neatly, you can exchange files and data 1 If you&rsquo;re limited to just one Office file, it&rsquo;s cheaper to code with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which comes with Office, or use macro recording. If you have Office, you can use VBA and macros at no additional license cost. However, if you use VBA, you should avoid getting caught in the pitfalls of coding too complex tasks where only the person who coded can fix the automation.</p>
<p>When it comes to complicated tasks such as handling multiple Office files, it is easier to use RPA as a whole, and the number and quality of engineers to be placed may be lower, which improves cost performance. Even in that case, there is also a method to improve the stability of operation by writing a macro for the processing that fits in one Office file and calling it from RPA.</p>
<h1 id="3-web-scraping-alone">3. Web scraping alone</h1>
<p>RPA recommendation level: ⭐☆☆☆☆</p>
<p>In the case of Web scraping that extracts specific text or table of Web page, if it is complicated enough to extract only one place on one page, if there is a programmer or engineer, free of charge such as SikuliX, Selium etc. It is cheaper to write it with an automation tool or a programming language such as Python. If you are handling complex data that spans multiple pages, if you want to continue using the retrieved data in other applications, or if you do not have an engineer, you may want to use RPA. However, deploying RPA solely for web scraping purposes can be expensive.</p>
<h1 id="4-web-form-and-application-form-autofill">4. Web Form and Application Form Autofill</h1>
<p>RPA recommendation level: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆</p>
<p>When automating the input work to the form of Web or Windows application, let&rsquo;s first search for a way to input the same with API cooperation. If there is no way, you will need to recognize the UI element and enter the value. In some cases, it can be implemented with a free automation tool such as SikuliX or Selium or a programming language such as Python, but it tends to be difficult to process. Also, if the screen changes frequently, the code will be rewritten frequently and the management cost will increase. In such a case, using RPA is recommended because it is easier to carry out. Use RPA software that easily grabs the UI elements of the target form. Please note that the RPA software will make a difference in input accuracy depending on the type of application such as SAP or remote desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li>User registration and usage confirmation</li>
<li>Input to business systems such as accounting, human resources, CRM, ERP (when input is not possible with API)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="5-automation-of-a-series-of-flows-that-connect-businesses">5. Automation of a series of flows that connect businesses</h1>
<p>RPA recommendation level: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
<p>If you want to automate a series of workflows, such as &ldquo;OCR the image file, extract the text, perform the verification work, and enter the result in the form&rdquo;, use RPA software. It is recommended. RPA software is easy to realize its value and is more cost-effective when connecting multiple data sets and software.</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue invoice</li>
<li>Transportation expense settlement check function with expense settlement</li>
<li>Expense payee check</li>
<li>Bulk email transmission</li>
<li>System usage monitoring and reporting</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="6-automation-of-processes-that-require-human-judgment-in-the-middle-of-business-flow">6. Automation of processes that require human judgment in the middle of business flow</h1>
<p>RPA recommendation level: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
<p>Again, this can be done by building in RPA via a chatbot. The chatbot performs the flow of inquiring about a person when it is absolutely necessary to make a decision by the person, and the RPA is responsible for the connection there.</p>
<ul>
<li>Call center to determine difficult issues</li>
<li>Judgment when the character read by OCR is difficult to judge</li>
</ul>
