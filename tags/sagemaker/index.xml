      <description>SageMaker, a machine learning management service of AWS, does not come out with pinpoint points, so I will summarize it.  Amazon SageMaker features When operating the ML system in the production environment, the managed function is really effective. A component for realizing MLops and MDLC. The true benefit cannot be obtained only by developing the PoC model.

      <description>What is #SageMaker Autopilot?  AWS provides automatic preprocessing, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter optimization. It&amp;rsquo;s AutoML that runs on SageMaker. This time, I have an Autopilot sample, so I&amp;rsquo;d like to actually run it. â†’Autopilot sample
Try running the sample First, create the required libraries and Session.
import sagemaker import boto3 from sagemaker import get_execution_role region = boto3.Session().region_name session = sagemaker.Session() bucket = session.default_bucket() prefix =&#39;sagemaker/autopilot-dm&#39; role = get_execution_role() sm = boto3.</description>

      <description># My background  Amazon? Ah, you know, you know, a mail order app. Not long ago, knowledge about Amazon was that much. Of course, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know AWS.
I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed as an information undergraduate student. 
However, as a 3rd year university student, I was introduced to the lab and learned about AWS. In addition, I am addicted to the topic &amp;ldquo;Atsuhiko Nakata&amp;rsquo;s YouTube University&amp;rdquo;, which is a hot topic in this street.</description>
