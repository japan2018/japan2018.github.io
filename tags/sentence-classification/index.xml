      <description>This article is from the 25th day of [Pytorch Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/pytorch)!  #Introduction
Previous implemented Attention in Encoder-Decoder model, but this time, I will implement sentence classification in Self Attention.
The embedded expression of sentences in Self Attention is introduced in the following paper, and is also quoted in the famous paper &amp;ldquo;Attention Is All You Need&amp;rdquo; by Transformer.
 A STRUCTURED SELF-ATTENTIVE SENTENCE EMBEDDING  This article implements the Self Attention introduced in this paper.</description>
