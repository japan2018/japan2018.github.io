      <description>First article posted as job hunting news.  I tried to read and implement a paper on IIC (Invariant Information Clustering), which is said to be highly accurate and has unsupervised learning. IIC is a method of clustering by maximizing mutual information. IIC paper here
 Invariant Information Clustering for Unsupervised Image Classification and Segmentation Xu Ji, Jo√£o F. Henriques, Andrea Vedaldi
 The framework used is TensorFlow 2.0. The target data is familiar MNIST.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  I am currently a M2 student majoring in CS. I usually write machine learning code in PyTorch. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to write for the time being. PyTorch is said to be &amp;ldquo;Define by Run&amp;rdquo;**, and what is good at the same time when the calculation graph and data are sent is that it is easy to debug because you can check the calculation results on the way. As a PyTorch believer, I need to write code in TensorFlow this time, so I will keep a memo so that I don&amp;rsquo;t forget the know-how at that time.</description>

1. Introduction I remade the MobileNet V2-SSD Lite training environment construction article that I wrote about a year ago into an ultra-simple specification. If you start work from the stage where the latest Docker for GPU is introduced, I think you can start training in about 15 minutes. I think there are almost no mistakes. After learning, I plan to do Integer Quantization of the trained model (.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  I thought about learning AI and making a simple application with the technology I learned, I tried to make something like the following. The reason why I chose Anpanman was because it was a cartoon character that I could easily write. I wanted to handle GAN as a model, and that it is possible to detect abnormalities by learning only normal images I thought I would make it ANOGAN, but when I looked it up, it was called EfficientGAN in the high-speed version of ANOGAN.</description>

      <description>It is the 11th day of [TensorFlow2.0 Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/tensorflow2).  I would like to summarize the method of preprocessing text using tf.data.Dataset API.
This article will explain in the following order.
 Explain what the tf.data.Dataset API is and how effective it is Explain the actual text preprocessing procedure Summary of tips for improving performance  Since the explanation is long (the code is long&amp;hellip;) If you want to take a bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view by looking at only the code, here.</description>

First try to move I will purchase the program and try it. As described in the explanation, basically it worked with copy and paste, but the following two places did not work as they are, so I fixed it here.
 Parsing date data Column names of features used for learning and inference  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look exactly the same because it contains random elements, but the graphs also moved in roughly the same way, so it seems to have been reproduced.</description>

This article is for beginners. Unity beginners mimic one of ML-Agents official tutorials do it It is one of the machine learning, __ which I tried __ Reinforcement Learning.
I will make something like this. :arrow_up:__
For those who know how to operate Unity easily, but who have not done machine learning yet. Rather than focusing on theory, I introduce you to Zakuri so that you can experience while moving your hands.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I was told that &amp;ldquo;AI takes away human work&amp;rdquo; **, but now some people say that &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m in a period of disillusionment&amp;rdquo; **. Thanks to that, I was not robbed of my work, and I am swayed by a crowded train every day. The scams that rob you are also a good thing.
While the development of such AI seems to take a little longer, it is now easy to obtain an environment for learning.</description>

      <description>I have a personality that I don&#39;t want to think too deeply about, and I would like to have a rough and intuitive understanding if possible.  So let&amp;rsquo;s do a little research on this loss function as well so that we can understand it intuitively.
What is a loss function? What is a loss function in the first place? It&amp;rsquo;s a difficult function to explain, but it seems to be a function that reduces the difference between two values.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Until now, we have been doing deep learning by running Tensorflow on the back end of Keras. If you just do machine learning in Python, you can use Keras as before, but there are applications where you want to use models and weights learned in Python in C++. Actually, it would be nice to use a model trained with Keras, but it seems easier to code directly with Tensorflow which also has a C++ API, so I will try to attack from there.</description>

pip install Keras All you have to do is change the config file and select Theano or Tensorflow. If you use Tensorflow in the backend, it will automatically use the GPU.
When using Tensorflow with Keras, the following errors may occur as of January 2017.</description>

      <description>## Intro  This is the 9th day article of TensorFlow Advent Calendar 2016.
TensorFlow was released in November 2015, but the &amp;ldquo;namespace&amp;rdquo; function was supported from the beginning. This is used in graph visualization with TensorBoard, but of course it&amp;rsquo;s not the only one. Namespaces are very useful for managing identifiers. I recall C++ when it comes to strong &amp;ldquo;namespace&amp;rdquo; support, but I&amp;rsquo;ll quote it from a C++ instruction book (self-study C++).</description>

      <description>Use **tf.train.Saver** to save and load the parameters learned by Tensorflow.  Save To save, use the save method of the saver class you created.
saver = tf.train.Saver() Some processing #Save saver.save(sess, &amp;quot;model.ckpt&amp;quot;) Saving can be done at the end of learning or at a timing in the middle of learning.
read When loading, use the restore method of the saver class you created. You need a session, so load it after creating the session.</description>
