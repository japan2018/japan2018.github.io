      <description>There was a noise removal method that I was convinced that there is a method like this in the kaggle kernel (notebook now), so I will summarize the things I examined about it below with notes.  Method overview An analysis method for a certain signal or waveform is called wavelet transform. I think that I often imagine the Fourier transform as an analysis method, but the Fourier transform expands the waveform to the sum of trigonometric functions (Sain, Kosain), whereas the wavelet transform decomposes it into a waveform of any shape.</description>
