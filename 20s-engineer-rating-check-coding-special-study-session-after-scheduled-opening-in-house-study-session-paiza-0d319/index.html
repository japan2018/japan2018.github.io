<hr>
<p>My current affiliation is the system development department, and the department that refurbishes and maintains existing packages.
We are active in a cycle of renovating and releasing our long-lived in-house package (LAMP configuration) once every two months.
The members of the development department range from those with deep experience as engineers to employees who are new graduates.</p>
<p>In that situation, I checked the rating using Paiza, and it is a report and impression.</p>
<p>Why did you decide to hold a study session?</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>There is no opportunity to write code in scratch because we are focusing on the repair and maintenance of our own package</li>
<li>Aside from mid-career employees, there is no opportunity for new graduates to come into contact with languages other than those in their own packaging.</li>
<li>There is no opportunity for members to know the skills of each person</li>
</ul>
<p>What i did</p>
<hr>
<p>I talked to 5 to 6 development members in their 20s and solved the problem of <a href="https://paiza.jp/">Paiza</a> about twice a week.
Paiza is a site where you can measure the coding speed and the execution speed by coding the problems that you have raised in an online execution environment.
Paiza was chosen because it has an online execution environment and no software installation is required, so anyone can join immediately.</p>
<p>The reason why I am in my twenties is that all of the boys and girls in our twenties, who are in the R&amp;D department, are single people. It&rsquo;s not age discrimination.</p>
<p>Content/Rules</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>No programming language restrictions</li>
<li>(Because there are some children from different branches) All people connect Hangout video call and start good</li>
<li>When the answer is over, put the screenshot of the answer result screen on the Hangouts chat (for evidence only)</li>
<li>Approximately everyone will have a review time when they finish solving, and code reviews for all</li>
</ul>
<p>Use whatever language you like</p>
<hr>
<p>I thought that it would be all over PHP because my company&rsquo;s package is LAMP,
There were some children who tried C#, golang, and swift, which I was not used to.</p>
<p>I think the advantage is that we can compete in logic construction ability without depending on the language specifications.
Also, everyone was able to learn the specifications of other languages that they would not normally touch.</p>
<p>After completing the solution, do a code review</p>
<hr>
<p>Depending on the problem, there were also problems in which the solution was quite different depending on the person.
Some children use functions that everyone doesn&rsquo;t know, and some have unique solving methods.
There was a technical debate about who code was and why it was good and bad.
Also, I think that the code created by a new graduate child was a strange way that other members could not raise, but it was efficient, or I could see something that I can not see in my usual work ..</p>
<p>What happened when I continued</p>
<hr>
<p>Other members of the development department (in their thirties and above) have also become interested.
In addition, participating young members (including myself) are now learning at Paiza at home.</p>
<p>In addition, there was also the aspect of competing for the execution speed of processing.
For example, is it possible to rewrite in python the processing that takes 1 second if it is assembled in C# with a process that requires a loop and keep it below 1 second! ? Etc.</p>
<p>Summary: good things</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>When you call out, it&rsquo;s outside the scheduled time, but unexpectedly everyone will participate</li>
<li>Development members have a little habit of learning</li>
<li>Increased knowledge that is useful in daily work</li>
<li>Increased knowledge of languages that other members have know-how and are not using in their daily work</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary: future challenges</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Limited number of people to talk and plan (I was almost myself this time)</li>
<li>How to keep the voices from other members</li>
<li>How to use the time that the respondents wait for the challengers</li>
<li>What kind of criteria should be used when someone is challenging?</li>
</ul>
<p>at the end</p>
<hr>
<p>I would like to improve the skills of the development members in-house! If there is someone who says,
I hope you can refer to it if you like!</p>
<p>Next time, I would like to report on the Lightning Talk that involved the entire development department.</p>
