      <description>#Overview  It seems that a coding test is conducted in an engineer&amp;rsquo;s interview overseas, and in many cases, the main thing is to implement a specific function or class according to the subject.
As a countermeasure, it seems that the site called Leet Code will be implemented.
A site that trains the algorithm power to withstand the coding tests that are being conducted in the early days.
I think it is better to have at least as much algorithmic power as an impatient person, so I think that I will occasionally solve the problem and write down the method I thought at that time in a memo.</description>
