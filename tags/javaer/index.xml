      <description># at first  This is the 12/2 charge article for PyCon JP Advent Calendar 2016. There are other interesting articles, so if you are interested, please check it out. I have written Java in some places, but it may be wrong because it has been a while, so I hope you can read it while thinking about it.
Purpose As the subject says, I&amp;rsquo;ll share the mistakes I&amp;rsquo;ve made so that anyone reading this can make the transition from Javaer to Pythonista smoother.</description>
