      <description>## Overview  Type hints added in PEP484 since Python 3.5. I think that it can be applied to ndarray of numpy,anditisatypehintstaticchecktoolmypy, and the results of the wp investigation, such as dealing with third party modules.
Conclusion In conclusion, type hint checking of numpy.ndarray using mypy is possible using numpy-stubs. However, as of now (January 2020), mypy check cannot be performed by specifying the dtype and shape of ndarray. On the other hand, if you want to add type hints including dtype and shape as annotations for readability, the option to use nptyping seems good.</description>
