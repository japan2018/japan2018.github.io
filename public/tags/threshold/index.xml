      <description>Recently, I often talk about talk about wanting to automatically determine the threshold, so I summarized it.  Threshold design corresponds to two-dimensional unsupervised clustering of two groups. Yes. This time, we will summarize 5 classical and useful methods, taking image binarization as an example.
Note: If the distribution system is unknown, there is no correct answer for threshold determination
Preparation This time I will use this photo taken properly. The brightness histogram of this image is as follows.</description>
