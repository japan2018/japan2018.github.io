      <description># theme  A job that operates a real estate system as a service, a story broke out that there is no loss in doing hands-on at the field level. That&amp;rsquo;s why we decided to challenge kaggle&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;House Price&amp;rdquo; problem, which is a famous title. So, if you make a note of this properly, it will be useful for later, so I decided to post it to qiita after reading the line by line.</description>

      <title>[Python] Denoising method using wavelet transform</title>

      <description>There was a noise removal method that I was convinced that there is a method like this in the kaggle kernel (notebook now), so I will summarize the things I examined about it below with notes.  Method overview An analysis method for a certain signal or waveform is called wavelet transform. I think that I often imagine the Fourier transform as an analysis method, but the Fourier transform expands the waveform to the sum of trigonometric functions (Sain, Kosain), whereas the wavelet transform decomposes it into a waveform of any shape.</description>

      <title>[Python] I tried to predict Titanic survival on PyCaret</title>

      <description>#Introduction  The other day, I tried using the machine learning library PyCaret that was released. Data feature analysis and performance comparison work with multiple models will be automated, and the work time of data scientists up to now will be considerably reduced.
This time, I will apply PyCaret to the Titanic survival prediction problem, submit the prediction result to Kaggle, and see the result.
**This is a follow-up article to I tried to classify wine quality with PyCaret, which I posted last time.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  As I was about to get a job (spring break in the fourth year of university), I suddenly wanted to become a data scientist, so I started working on Kaggle for the time being.
This time, I worked on a tutorial of Kaggle&amp;quot;Titanic&amp;rdquo;.
I have experience in statistical analysis in my research, but since I do not understand machine learning at all, I decided to study with reference to the code of the incredibly excellent person!</description>

      <description>Do you know UMAP?  I know
If you&amp;rsquo;ve heard it but don&amp;rsquo;t know it, this article will help you understand it.
#What is UMAP
It is a method to reduce and visualize dimensions faster and with higher performance than t-SNE. Compare with the commonly used t-SNE. The following figure is a visualization of Fashion MNIST.
(From Understanding UMAP)
Compared to t-SNE, UMAP seems to have distinct clusters. Similar categories are placed near each other and dissimilar categories are placed far away.</description>

      <description>In this article, I will write something like a standard for each data type in the Kaggle competition. In addition, I think it would be nice if it could be a hint when accuracy is not obtained regardless of the competition.  This time we will touch on the following competition datasets. In the case of competition, there is no Kernel, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to put together Notebooks. Predict Future Sales Avocado Prices</description>

This time we will look at various kernels, not just the competition.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  There are increasing opportunities for anyone to learn machine learning, such as kaggle and learning sites. On the other hand, I feel that there are many people who have too much information and don&amp;rsquo;t get the overall feeling.
Therefore, I will publish the methods used in machine learning introduced in various reference books and articles. Please refer to that link for detailed coding.
Since various information is also sent on SNS, please feel free to read the article.</description>

      <description>This article is from the 19th day of [Kaggle Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/kaggle).  Hi, my name is kiccho1101! Writing an article for the first time in my life! Thank you!
Introduction This time, I tried to use Kaggle&amp;rsquo;s feature quantity management with PostgreSQL, but it was faster than I thought, so I would like to introduce it.
The created directory is here: https://github.com/kiccho1101/datascience-template ↑ The README has a usage example using the data of Titanic competition.</description>

      <description>#GCP had a great feature added  Previously, I wrote an article Easily build a GCP environment for Kaggle. This time, I found an easier way to build it, so I&amp;rsquo;ll write it as an improved version of the previous article. A notebook function has been added to the lower AI platform. What this means is that you can get it ready for use without having to do the work to make the jupyter notebook introduced in the previous article.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  ###Self-introduction My name is Chizu Chizu. I&amp;rsquo;m 14 and I&amp;rsquo;m 2 now. It is a hobby type, but I was particularly typing. (Past tense)
Now I&amp;rsquo;m a low skill Kagler.
I got a bronze medal in &amp;ldquo;tentatively&amp;rdquo; IEEE. We&amp;rsquo;ll see later on why it&amp;rsquo;s a tentative one.
After getting tired of AtCoder, I got into Kaggle. I will definitely become a master by my own power.

#kaggle&amp;rsquo;s say depends on status
Users are ranked in kaggle. It is called Progression. It&amp;rsquo;s a progress level or something like a title.
Depending on this rank, the degree of attention to the posted script and the degree of influence of the statement differ.
When you register, you will be given the title novice, and if you meet certain conditions, you will become Contributor, If you want to become a higher rank from there, you must make statements that collect good evaluations from others, obtain medals, etc.</description>

      <description>#1.First of all  Since I started studying machine learning, I tried Kaggle&amp;rsquo;s tutorial for beginners, Titanic.
At first, I tried to play around with the feature amount on my own, referring to Japanese Web information, but even if the training data showed good accuracy, when I submitted the test data, the accuracy did not rise as expected, It was difficult to break the wall of 80% and I was in agony.</description>

      <description>## 0. Abstract   In many cases, huge earthquakes (M&amp;gt;8) are triggered by the deformation of the earth due to tidal stress caused by the moon. There were also some papers that treated the earthquakes that occurred in the past statistically and discussed the relationship with the tide. However, it goes without saying that even though we discussed the Tidal Phase Angle, we could not find anything that clearly showed Lunar Age or Lunar Phase.</description>
