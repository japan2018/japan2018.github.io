      <description>*Memo will be updated at any time*  Aiming to build a python development environment
In the environment I upgraded from Mojave to Catalina, when I did it normally, it did not work as expected with python3 or pip3 due to the difference in version, so I try using pyenv and see if it works.
It&amp;rsquo;s actually better to use Docker, but for now&amp;hellip;
homebrew Start from here.

      <description>I was writing because I was thinking of scraping with python,  If the same IP address is accessed for a certain period of time, the access will be denied for a while. When a site like this appears, it may not be possible to scrape well, so I will try to impersonate the IP address and scrape.
However, since the operation is confirmed only for macOS, I think that the method is a little different especially for windows.</description>

      <description>#1. About this article  ##1-1. Introduction This article was touched by me as a high school student when I received [Udemy: An Introduction to Blockchain Development from Scratch Beginning with Python Taught by Active Silicon Valley Engineers](https://www.udemy.com/share/1021OSAkIbdVdQQXo=/) , I wrote this article with the hope that everyone reading this article should attend. I completed this lesson in 2 days, so if you are already accustomed to development, I think it is sufficiently possible to understand and implement in 1 day.</description>

      <description>#Beware of data scientists  As of 2019, there should be a lot of people out there who want to be distracted by data scientists. However, those who don&amp;rsquo;t know how to be more pretentious than others. I completely removed the muddy data scientist aspect and wondered how I could be distracted. You can put your conclusion into practice immediately tomorrow. If you want to be a data scientist, give it a try.</description>

      <description># Overview  This article is a step-by-step article on how a beginner himself developed a coupon distribution service for iPhone with RESTful API and swift. It was a very detouring implementation because we implemented it while examining the technical elements one by one.
Python is originally installed on the Mac, but the version is old as of OS 10.15. When actually writing Python, everyone seems to have been updated to 3 series.</description>
