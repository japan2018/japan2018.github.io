<pre><code>## Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>Hello, My name is Kano.
At ABEJA, I am in charge of customer support for Insight for Retail, a retail service.</p>
<p>Recently, I am living a vegan life under the influence of a documentary called <a href="https://www.netflix.com/jp/title/81157840">Game Changer</a> that I watched on Netflix.
However, I sometimes eat Jiro, family, or cottery ramen, so I can&rsquo;t lose weight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an engineer, but I will do my best to write it.
This is the article on the 13th day of ABEJA Advent Calendar 2019.</p>
<h2 id="trigger">Trigger</h2>
<p>At ABEJA, I feel that engineers are really enjoying making things.</p>
<p>Of course, so is work, but there are things that are not related to work.
For example, <a href="https://qiita.com/peisuke/items/f836aa245eb54b703cee">stock AI</a>or<a href="https://twitter.com/xecus/status/1197158668073979904">ShiitakecultivationusingIoTdevices</a>.</p>
<p>Joining ABEJA in 2018 and working with them every day, I became more and more motivated to create something.</p>
<p>In addition, ABEJA cherishes <a href="https://tech-blog.abeja.asia/entry/technopreneurship">technopreneurship</a>, and the idea that business members can innovate only by utilizing technology has spread. I was also doing it.</p>
<h2 id="customer-support-role-for-insight-for-retail-service">Customer support role for Insight for Retail service</h2>
<p>By the way, if you explain about the service called Insight for Retail that I am in charge of very roughly,</p>
<p>・Install data from IoT devices such as cameras at retail stores
・AI analyzes the acquired data
・Aggregate the analyzed data and visualize it easily
・And realize data-driven store management</p>
<p>Is that.</p>
<p>Therefore, when introducing the service, IoT devices must be installed in stores, but the construction work is also included in the role of customer support.
More specifically, &ldquo;providing AI with clean data suitable for analysis from IoT devices&rdquo; is one of the important missions of Insight for Retail customer support.</p>
<p>(Although it is not related to this article, customer support will also do research and verification of new IoT devices. Of course, customer support is also about inquiries and release announcements, so it is a normal SaaS company. I feel that it has a wider range of defense compared to the customer support of, so I would like to introduce this area if there is an opportunity.)</p>
<h2 id="i-want-to-detect-backlight">I want to detect backlight</h2>
<p>Now, when dealing with the data acquired by IoT devices every day as customer support, I realize that it is really difficult to acquire data in the real space.
For example, backlight.</p>
<p>Below are some pictures of my friends climbing Mt. Fuji this summer. The back light of the coming light is amazing.</p>
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/556409/b006922a-dc76-82b4-8556-5ac89535b740.jpeg" width="300px">
<p>One of the Insight for Retail services is that AI estimates age gender and whether it is a repeater based on the face image of the visitor, but with such a black face image, no matter how good AI model is The accuracy is not accurate, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Backlights up to this point rarely occur in actual stores, but there are occasions when the backlight darkens the face.
Moreover, backlighting may or may not come out depending on the time, so it is difficult to detect it during installation.</p>
<p>So, I decided to think that creating a mechanism that automates the detection of backlight would be useful for work, as well as for studying programming, and for studying image processing.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-backlighting-like">What is backlighting like?</h2>
<p>What kind of state is backlight in the first place?
To figure this out, try drawing a histogram of the backlit and non-backlit images.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://labs.eecs.tottori-u.ac.jp/sd/Member/oyamada/OpenCV/html/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_histograms/py_histogram_begins/py_histogram_begins.html">OpenCV Tutorial</a> for the explanation of the histogram. It&rsquo;s easy, but if you explain it roughly, it shows the distribution of the pixel value of each pixel in the image.
Pixel values are bright and large, and dark and small, so you can see the distribution of light and dark in the image by looking at the histogram.</p>
<p>(Although I wrote it briefly, I read various books on image processing to get here, and there were various things such as having an engineer tell me that there is a convenient image processing/CV library called OpenCV.)</p>
<p>The code to draw the histogram is below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">

</code></pre></div><p>First, the histogram of the backlight image. The image cropped the face part of the photograph of Mt. Fuji.
The backlit image has a darker face and is biased toward the smaller pixel value.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/556409/9fe1377c-3f74-5368-d2bd-66556c416e2a.jpeg" width="150px">&lt; img src=&quot;https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/556409/0fe609fc-df5c-fc7f-4f3d-76bac76f4777.png&rdquo; width=&quot;300px&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>Next is a histogram of an image that is not backlit. I&rsquo;m 7 years ago.
This image has a more even distribution of pixel values than the backlit image.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/556409/05567a9a-fd2e-d8ed-8650-ef266a7a2fa3.jpeg" width="150px">&lt; img src=&quot;https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/556409/f2b1b1d4-0e35-4202-7e03-e6d728ff6034.png&rdquo; width=&quot;300px&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>Therefore, I made a hypothesis that it could be judged as backlight if the median or average of the pixel values of the image is smaller than a certain value.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-some-backlight-that-makes-your-face-brighter">There is some backlight that makes your face brighter.</h2>
<p>However, when I searched the backlight image on the Web, I found that there was such a case.
(I didn&rsquo;t have any good images on hand, so I bought it at PIXTA.)</p>
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/556409/6f91b858-9cfa-5241-b5f7-d3861c411667.jpeg" width="300px">
<p>On the contrary, this backlight image makes the face too bright, which seems to affect the judgment accuracy.</p>
<p>The histogram looks like this:</p>
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/556409/68260c42-52b9-9b6b-ea1a-d1f681d0aa38.png" width="300px">
<p>This time it is biased toward the larger pixel value.
It seems impossible to use the strategy of judging by the number of average pixel values.
What do you do now?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the histogram of each image again.</p>
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/556409/ba4a175f-bee0-9e55-6ff6-3e0f854eac7c.png">
<p>Looking at this, the backlight image in both cases has a biased distribution of pixel values compared to the non-backlit image.
So, I thought that the backlight could be used to judge the backlight.
Specifically, it seems good to calculate the standard deviation of the pixel values of the image (a value that indicates the degree of data scattering).</p>
<h2 id="backlight-judgment-based-on-the-standard-deviation-of-pixel-values-of-the-image">Backlight judgment based on the standard deviation of pixel values of the image</h2>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s calculate the standard deviation of the pixel values of the image using OpenCV.</p>
<p>Click here for the code.
OpenCV is very convenient because you can write such calculations with a few lines of code.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">

<span style="color:#66d9ef">print</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;stddev&#39;</span>,stddev)

</code></pre></div><p>The results are as follows.</p>
<p>First, from an image that is not backlit. The standard deviation here was <font color="Red">55.6</font>.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/556409/05567a9a-fd2e-d8ed-8650-ef266a7a2fa3.jpeg" width="200px"></p>
<p>Backlit with a dark face next. The standard deviation was <font color="Red">32.0</font>.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/556409/9fe1377c-3f74-5368-d2bd-66556c416e2a.jpeg" width="200px"></p>
<p>Backlight that makes a bright face at the end. The standard deviation was <font color="Red">36.7</font>.<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/556409/6f91b858-9cfa-5241-b5f7-d3861c411667.jpeg" width="200px"></p>
<p>Summary,</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-backlit image: Standard deviation is <font color="Red">55.6</font></li>
<li>Backlit image (dark face): Standard deviation is <font color="Red">32.0</font></li>
<li>Backlit image (bright face): Standard deviation is <font color="Red">36.7</font></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, it seems possible to make a judgment by setting a threshold value around 40 to 50 and setting &ldquo;images with standard deviation less than the threshold value as backlight&rdquo;.
To apply it to the production environment, there are still many issues other than adjusting the threshold, such as processing to cut out only the face from the image, but that is not enough.</p>
<h2 id="impressions-i-tried">Impressions I tried</h2>
<p>Until now, when I was thinking of studying programming, I repeatedly bought a technical book, read it from the first page, and frustrated at about 10 pages, but like this time. I felt that it would be easier to learn if you actually created a theme, and above all, it would be fun to work through trial and error.
Programming means practicing Nambo.</p>
<p>Also, ABEJA engineers kindly teach me that there is something I do not understand, so I once again felt that it was a very good environment for business members to acquire technology. Thank you.
I will continue to decide the theme and continue to study.</p>
