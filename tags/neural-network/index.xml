Activation function Overview of NN Summary  The goal is to get a general idea of the neural network. I don&amp;rsquo;t use mathematical formulas, so people who are allergic to mathematics should also check it.
#1.What is a neural network?
A neural network is something like the one below. When written in English, it is Neural Network, so it is often abbreviated as NN.</description>

      <description>#What is neural style conversion?  Neural style conversion is one of the machine learning techniques that transforms a target image into the style (texture) of another image to generate a new image. It&amp;rsquo;s a technology used in apps that change Van Gogh&amp;rsquo;s image of a city or people. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s try using this technology to see if this time we can transform a real, ferocious crocodile image that seems to eat humans into a gentle crocodile crocodile by transforming its style into a crocodile style that will die 100 days later.</description>

      <description># First of all  This article is from the 7th day of the DMM WEBCAMP Advent Calendar. This time it&amp;rsquo;s a super introduction, so I created it for those who have never tried machine learning but want to start **.
The purpose is to get a rough idea of machine learning and try to implement a basic simple perceptron for the time being, so I&amp;rsquo;ve written a lot about the explanation of machine learning etc.</description>
