      <title>Foreign Coding Interview Measures in the leetcode Era</title>

      <description>Make a note of measures such as GAFAM or FAANG, or software engineer interview measures that tend to be similar to those (such as Indeed or PFN in Tokyo).  #Coding interview and leetcode
Foreign IT companies place great importance on coding interviews when hiring software engineers. It&amp;rsquo;s more like a programming contest problem, which is easier than business coding, and it seems common sense that American students and engineers take a few months of proactive measures when they receive an IT company.</description>

      <description>This is a collection of Python techniques, small tips and tricks useful for everyday programming.  We have confirmed the operation with Python 3.8.0.
Comparison of 3 or more values 1 == 2 == 3 # -&amp;gt; False 1 &amp;lt;2 &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;4 # -&amp;gt; True Time (datetime/date) comparison Flexible comparisons are possible thanks to magic methods.
Reference: [Python] Allow comparison operation in original class
from datetime import date feb1 = date(2020, 2, 1) feb2 = date(2020, 2, 2) feb3 = date(2020, 2, 3) feb1 &amp;lt;feb2 &amp;lt;= feb2 &amp;lt;feb3 # -&amp;gt; True Maximum/minimum time from datetime import date # Intentionally reverse order dates = [ date(2020, 2, 3), date(2020, 2, 2), date(2020, 2, 1), ] min(dates) # -&amp;gt; datetime.</description>

      <description>Hello! I am happy.  Sometimes I had problems with UnionFind, but I tended to use other people&amp;rsquo;s libraries, so I&amp;rsquo;ll write about it as a review. If you think that it&amp;rsquo;s like a forgetful personal note

      <description># Background  I thought about a low-cost way to learn programming from an empty situation. (Mac) Is the continuation of.
This time, I summarized how to take a smartphone and learn the program for free for those who are new to buying a PC.
OPAC-Library search system Perhaps it is OPAC that university graduates know but middle and high school graduates do not. If you are a university, you will be asked at the first orientation of your first year to search for books, magazines, papers, etc.</description>

      <description>#What is the difference between statistics and machine learning? Why can&#39;t I predict from machine learning today and make money?  Perhaps everyone wonders when they start studying machine learning. And why can&amp;rsquo;t many business companies use it for their daily work today? The question also comes up. There are various documents, but I was having trouble comprehending them, so I rearranged them myself. I&amp;rsquo;m putting together a lot of information by combining information.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  Have you ever experienced programming while studying programming?
** &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t make a product even after studying&amp;rdquo; ** ** &amp;ldquo;How do you do development in the first place?&amp;rdquo; ** What is the requirement definition?
In order to solve that problem, let&amp;rsquo;s first understand the overall feeling of development. See &amp;ldquo;Software development process&amp;rdquo; below
The programming I&amp;rsquo;m always studying corresponds to the &amp;ldquo;implementation&amp;rdquo; part. In other words, there are as many as four walls before you can exercise your programming skills.</description>

When you&amp;rsquo;re working with data, you inevitably come into contact with Excel. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t use it for yourself, it will be needed by clients and colleagues. Excel excels in spreadsheets with small datasets.
But I always lamented when I saw an Excel sheet with tens of thousands of rows and hundreds of columns.</description>
