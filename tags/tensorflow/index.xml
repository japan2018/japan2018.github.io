      <description>#Keras development end  It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I posted. As you can see on github, it seems that development of the multi-backend Keras ended in April 2020. It will be replaced by Keras in Tensorflow in the future. keras-team (For convenience, the multi-backend Keras is expressed as mb-keras, and the Tensorflow Keras is expressed as tf-keras.) I would like to compare and verify mb-keras and tf-keras in this article.</description>

      <description># What is Google Colaboratory  Jupyter notebook environment running on Google&amp;rsquo;s cloud. https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb
It&amp;rsquo;s free to use and no environment is required, so it&amp;rsquo;s convenient for learning Python.
In addition, GPU and TPU can be used to reduce machine learning execution time.
usage limit It is available free of charge, but there is a 12 hour continuous usage limit.
Be careful when using machine learning for a long time because the virtual machine will be disconnected after 12 hours.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Do you guys do it?
Machine learning
He has been touted for the last three years as the third AI boom. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, deep learning I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying silently these days, but it&amp;rsquo;s kind of difficult&amp;hellip;
This time, let&amp;rsquo;s leave that area and create a machine learning environment quickly. It&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly easy to make. (I think there are many reference articles, but I also use them as notes for myself)</description>

      <description>#Introduction  This is IchiLab from RHEMS Giken.
This time using the Object Detection API of TensorFlow, Let me detect the object I want to recognize, I finally tried it on an Android device.
Many helpful sites have helped me, Still, I had a lot of points that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t solve with just one or two pages.
In this article, I will pick up the parts that I stumbled upon to make a difference, I hope that the number of people who do the same will be reduced.</description>
