This time AtCoder Beginner Contest 107 B-Grid Compression Difficulty: 434
This theme, string operation
Ruby h, w = gets.split.map(&amp;amp;:to_i) a = [] h.times do |i| s = gets.chomp a.push(s) if s.index(&amp;#39;#&amp;#39;) end (w-1).downto(0) do |i| if a.all?{|x| x[i] ==&amp;#39;.&amp;#39;} a.each do |x| x[i] =&amp;#39;&amp;#39; end end end puts a a.push(s) if s.count(&amp;#39;.&amp;#39;) != w a.</description>

This time AtCoder Regular Contest 086 C-Not so Diverse Difficulty: 431
This theme, hash sorting
Ruby Speaking of duplicate lists, it&amp;rsquo;s a hash.
n, k = gets.split.map(&amp;amp;:to_i) a = gets.split.map(&amp;amp;:to_i) h = Hash.new(0) a.each do |x| h[x] += 1 end puts n-h.values.sort.reverse[0, k].inject(:+) h.sort_by{|key, v| -v}.each do |key, v| puts n-h.values.sort.reverse[0, k].inject(:+) ~~Ruby doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a destructive sort of hashes, but it seems to have few uses.</description>

This time AtCoder Grand Contest 033 A-Darker and Darker Difficulty: 1245
This theme, breadth-first search
Ruby This is an advanced version of AtCoder Typical Contest 002 A-breadth-first search that I solved earlier. In particular, there are severe conditions such as execution time limit: 1 sec.
h, w = gets.split.map(&amp;amp;:to_i) cm = Array.new(h + 2){Array.new(w + 2, 0)} que = [] 1.</description>

This time AtCoder Beginner Contest 131 D-Megalomania Difficulty: 594
This theme, array sort
Ruby It&amp;rsquo;s an array sort, so I think it&amp;rsquo;s easy to implement. ~~ I chose a lighter problem because it is the first Python. ~~
n = gets.to_i a = Array.new(n){gets.split.map(&amp;amp;:to_i)} a.sort_by!{|x| x[1]} ans = 0 n.times do |i| ans += a[i][0] if ans &amp;gt;a[i][1] puts &amp;#34;No&amp;#34; exit end end puts &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; a.</description>

      <description>In October 2019, I attended a certain programming school where I often see advertisements on youtube, and since November I have been in my current position as a machine learning engineer and data scientist.  Three months after graduating, I would like to write about what I learned from the school, what was useful, and what is difficult now.
Biography April 2015 Served as a research and development position for a food company for 4 years July 2019 Start of programming school learning October 2019, graduated from programming school November 2019 Job change as a machine learning engineer and data scientist</description>

      <description>#Introduction  I wrote Things like this before, but as an artisan, I was tempted to make my own tools.
 https://github.com/Kray-G/kinx  Looks like JavaScript, feels like Ruby, and it is the script language fitting in C programmers.    Well, even if you say no, it&amp;rsquo;s something you can find somewhere (I won&amp;rsquo;t say it here), but I&amp;rsquo;m lonely even if I&amp;rsquo;m self-satisfied, so let&amp;rsquo;s leave a footstep for commentary.</description>

      <guid>https://memotut.com/why-vbscript-true-is-1-4ef82/</guid>
      <description>According to the following documentation, VBScript&#39;s True is equivalent to `-1`.  True keyword 
Also, False is equivalent to 0.
False keyword 
On the other hand, in the C language, true is equivalent to 1 and false is equivalent to 0 in stdbool.h.
#ifndef __cplusplus  #define bool _Bool #define true 1 #define false 0  #else /* __cplusplus */Also, in JavaScript, if you cast true to an integer type, it will be 1.</description>

      <description>##background  While changing the environment setting of the personal computer, I could not use gnuplot or Ruby&amp;rsquo;s Narray with Cygwin, so I decided to replace it with bash. I also installed Python and Jupyter. #Bash on Ubuntu on Windows Installation I have referred to this article. Let&amp;rsquo;s install Bash on Ubuntu on Windows!  Go to Settings&amp;gt; Update &amp;amp; Security&amp;gt; For Developers and select Developer Mode. Start the command prompt, type bash and press Enter to start the installation.</description>

      <description># Overview  The impression that programming and languages that are aware of scalability, such as parallel/parallel processing, functional type, and reactive, have recently attracted attention. Therefore, we summarized the basic writing method of multi-process processing using three script languages often used in Web development.
