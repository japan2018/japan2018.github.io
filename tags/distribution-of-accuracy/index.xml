      <description>#Introduction  For the purpose of understanding the relationship between probability distributions, we have implemented and summarized functions that generate various probability distributions starting from Bernoulli distribution in Python. This article is for the following people.
 I have studied the basic probability distribution I have touched Python I want to understand the relationship between probability distributions  The implemented Python functions are as follows. The function names are bernolli and binom.</description>
