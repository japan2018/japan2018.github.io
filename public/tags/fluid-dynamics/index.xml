      <description>#Introduction  While also studying Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which is a discipline related to the simulation of fluids such as air and water, I would like to summarize (in multiple articles) the knowledge necessary to construct a numerical fluid analysis code for water.
I feel that computational fluid dynamics is a difficult academic subject, so I would like to write it so that even beginners can understand it as much as possible.</description>

I want to write it so that even beginners can understand it. It seems that many mistakes are included, so we would appreciate if you contact us when you discover it.</description>

      <title>[Python] Numerical calculation of compressible fluid by finite volume method</title>

      <description># 1.First of all  It is necessary to consider the compressibility of the fluid in the flow around a fast-moving object such as an aircraft or rocket, and in the phenomena involving strong pressure, temperature and density changes such as combustion and explosion. Compressible fluids have various phenomena such as sound waves, shock waves, and aerodynamic heating that are not found in incompressible fluids, and their numerical calculations have different difficulties from incompressible fluids.</description>
