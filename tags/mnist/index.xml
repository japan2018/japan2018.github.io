      <description>#Introduction  Hello My name is DNA1980. Recently GNN(Graph Neural Network) is popular. I also want to follow the flow and handle graphs, but there are many graph data in the world that I do not know well. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing when I classify&amp;hellip; Separately, I think that GNN can be applied if it can be dropped into a graph even if it does not have a graph structure from the beginning like a network, so I tried applying it to everyone&amp;rsquo;s favorite MNIST.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Nice to meet you all. This article is just an article that explains mnist_mlp.py line by line. It is for people who are interested in AI but haven&amp;rsquo;t touched it yet. I think that if you read this, you should understand the basic learning flow of deep learning, so I will write. (Originally, it was created in-house with the intention of using it for training)
