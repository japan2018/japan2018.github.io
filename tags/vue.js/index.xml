      <description># Overview  I am actively using GCP, but I thought that Cloud run + Firebase would be good if I wanted to make a service cheaply and easily, so I summarized it. As for maintainability, I think Cloud run is better when comparing Cloud run and Cloud Functions.
Development environment list  Source Repository Cloud build Cloud run Firebase(hosting)  #Introduction First, enable the service in the above environment. The minimum required IAM for gcloud is as follows.</description>

      <description>#Motivation  Hello @glassmonkey. CI is Github Action. Since I wanted to try using images if I did CI, I tried a visual regression test easily. I made it in a rush, so I would appreciate any feedback.
#What is a visual regression test?
The explanation on Astamuse-sama&amp;rsquo;s blog was easy to understand, so I will quote it.
 The visual regression test is a visual regression test, specifically a test that takes a screenshot and extracts the differences.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  Looking at my post on Qiita, I see three numbers: &amp;ldquo;Page view&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Like&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Stock&amp;rdquo;. I like the &amp;ldquo;likes&amp;rdquo; of all posts on my page, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know the View and Stock of each post or the total. Since I have about 20 posts, I decided to try various methods to get all of my posts, views, likes, and stocks for studying.
When I looked it up, everyone hit the Qiita API in various ways to obtain information, and there are many reference pages, so I will carry out it while checking them.</description>
