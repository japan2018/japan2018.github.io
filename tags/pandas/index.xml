      <title>[Python] Simultaneous visualization of data and understanding of correlation</title>

      <description>#Introduction  When analyzing data, I think you will visualize the data using graphs. At that time, it would be convenient if the statistics showing the correlation between two variables could be displayed at the same time. Therefore, we made it possible to display the appropriate statistics on the appropriate graph according to the content of the variable (category or numerical value).
Review so far I will summarize the appropriate graphing methods by content of variables and the statistics that show the correlation, which have been described so far.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  The route map and the graph network are compatible, and we will touch on the shortest path problem that anyone can think of when trying to think about something on the route map.
Convert the railway route map into a simple graph problem, and use the Dijkstra method to find the shortest route. The Python library NetworkX has a built-in Dijkstra method, so this time we will use it.</description>

      <description>## PDF data  People in the world seem to love PDF, and even if they say they hate it, they have to deal with it. However, it is common for people to think that spending hours on it is a bit&amp;hellip; In some cases, there is only PDF table data, but in such a case there was a very convenient library called tabula-py.

      <description>## Overview  Even if you try to analyze the access log of Apache, Tomcat, etc., it is not a surprisingly good tool. I would like to have a tool that supports various output formats and that can filter only the necessary information and visualize it easily, but I can not find it easily.
So, I tried using Pandas and Matplotlib, which are standard in the world of data analysis, to analyze and visualize Apache access logs on Jupyter Notebook.</description>

      <description>There are several libraries that visualize data in Python, but Pandas alone is quite good.  Visualization using Pandas can be completed in the method chain, which can prevent random scattering of temporary variables. In this article, I will introduce visualization recipes, focusing on the ones I often use in practice.

Do you use a matching app? ! I feel good as one of those who have recently matched with a matching app.
By the way, the matching app I was using was able to refer to the data of other popular members. (Probably people who have received more than 100 like are displayed.)
When I saw it, I was disappointed.

      <description>The conclusion is according to the title. [Written in official documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.copy.html).  A colleague said, &amp;ldquo;The pandas assign method makes a copy of the data frame internally, so I&amp;rsquo;m having trouble eating up memory and being slow.&amp;rdquo;
I read &amp;ldquo;The Recursive Substitution Eradication Committee for Python/pandas Data Processing&amp;rdquo;, and I&amp;rsquo;m addicted to writing a clean batch of statistics using a method chain. It was.

      <description>When analyzing data with python, it is common (and likely) to use a module called pandas.  In pandas, data can be stored in types such as Series and Dataframe. Series is used to store one-dimensional data, and Dataframe is used to store two-dimensional data. They are like highly functional one-dimensional arrays and two-dimensional arrays, respectively. High functionality means that each row and column can be named, and many methods are available.</description>

The subject is &amp;ldquo;Is there a NaN in the pandas DataFrame?&amp;rdquo; As a simple check that the data is processed properly, I want to check the NaN value in the data frame and where it is. If you want to fill/delete NaN, you can use fillna()/dropna(), but what I want to do now is &amp;ldquo;Check if there is a NaN and display that row (column).</description>

      <description>## What is average pairwise correlation  I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many people in the world need to do this calculation.
The average pairwise stock correlation is the average of the correlation coefficients of price movements between stocks. In general, during the crisis such as the Lehman shock or the European debt crisis, the market as a whole will fall sharply, and then it will rise sharply in reaction, and the correlation coefficient between stocks will increase.</description>
