      <description>#Introduction  Last time Following the implementation of Seq2Seq, this time I tried to implement Attention Seq2Seq which added Attention to Seq2Seq with PyTorch.
Even beginners like me can&amp;rsquo;t find the source code that implements Attention in PyTorch so easily, and there is also PyTorch Attention Tutorial.Thereis,butitseemsthatIhavenotlearnedmini-batch(?),andIwantedtotryimplementingsimplerplain(?) Attention with such feeling that it was customized for this task. I tried to implement Attention by myself. It would be greatly appreciated if we could provide some helpful information to those who are having trouble implementing Attention.</description>
