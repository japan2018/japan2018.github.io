      <description>#Introduction  AtCoder Problems is used to solve past problems. Thank you, AtCoder and AtCoder Problems.
This time AtCoder JSC2019 Qual B-Kleene Inversion Difficulty: 797
The theme of this time, sum of arithmetic sequences + inverse element
Ruby For the first time, I&amp;rsquo;ll hear the number of falls, but let&amp;rsquo;s see what the number of falls is for the example 1 3 2.
   K 3 2 1 Total     132   1 1   132 132  4 1 5   132 132 132 7 4 1 12   One 1 3 2 is 1, two side by side 1 3 2 1 3 2 is 4 + 1, and three are 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 is 7 You can see that the sum is + 4 + 1 and the arithmetic progression.</description>
