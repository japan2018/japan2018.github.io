      <description>The web application we will create this time is an OCR (character recognition) application that will upload an image containing characters and will recognize it and display it as a string.  The app uses Python 3, Flask, Cognitive Services from Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s AI service, and more. Deployment to the cloud (Microsoft Azure) is automatic deployment of git push trigger.
Thank you! This OCR app is made by Microsoft engineer Christopher Harrison.</description>
