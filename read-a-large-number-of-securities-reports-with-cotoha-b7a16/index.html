<pre><code>#Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what a financial report is and I don&rsquo;t know what it says, and even if I read the contents of a particular year of a company I want to know, I do not understand unless I compare it with other companies / other years: frowning2:
So let&rsquo;s explore <strong>how to read a large number of securities reports using COTOHA</strong>: wink:</p>

<p>There are three major problems.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Data may be missing, ** companies that were in one year may disappear in one year **.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since 2017, the item of 2. Business status has been changed, and the contents of the file may be empty **
<font color="Gray"> *This is a problem of EDINET rather than CoARiJ =&gt; <a href="https://github.com/chakki-works/xbrr/blob/master/docs/edinet.md">Reference</a>&lt; /font&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>There may be missing total sales and operating income figures</strong> that should have been described in data/interim/&lt;year&gt;/documents.csv

<h1 id="analyze-business-status-of-securities-report-using-cotoha">Analyze [Business Status] of Securities Report using COTOHA</h1>
<p>The securities report has various items lined up. How do you read it?</p>
<p>In my case
From 1. [Company Overview] **, read the changes in total sales, operating income, ordinary income, and equity ratio.
<strong>2. Carefully read [Business Status]</strong>
**Skip reading after 3.</p>
<p>I am taking the style
So, this time, let&rsquo;s focus on <font color="DeepPink"><strong>1. [Overview of company]</strong> and **2. [Business situation]**</font>.</p>
<p>In CoARiJ <strong>1. [Overview of company]</strong> is <a href="https://qiita.com/vbnshin/items/dd7057a11bcfad320b6d">because it is collected in .csv file</a>, *<em>2. [Business situation]</em> Input .txt file of * into COTOHA</p>

<li>[Business risks]

<p>This item does not change much in most cases, so <strong><font color="DeepPink">similarity judgment</font></strong> is performed to check if it is different from the previous year, and if it is different, * Shorten the text using <em><font color="DeepPink">Summary (β)</font></em>*</p>
<p>I wanted to handle the text as it is, but if I request a text with more than 3000 characters (too long url?), a 500 (Internal Server Error) will be output **, so the text will be divided.</p>

<p>Regarding <strong>cash flow</strong>, we check if it is positive with <strong><font color="DeepPink">Sentiment analysis</font></strong>, and it is judged as negative although operating income or ordinary income is increasing. If so, use the original text, otherwise use <strong><font color="DeepPink">Summary (β)</font></strong> to shorten the text.
As for <strong>R&amp;D activities</strong>, words that are unfamiliar are lined up, so <strong><font color="DeepPink">proprietary expression extraction</font></strong> was performed to check roughly what content is included. Later, use <strong><font color="DeepPink">Summary (β)</font></strong></p>

When a quality problem occurs, we make a comprehensive judgment based on its hazard and spreadability, and take appropriate measures.However, if a large-scale product recall that exceeds our expectations occurs, it will seriously affect the performance of the Group. May have a negative impact. Therefore, we are working on promotion of work style reform, improvement of working environment, automation of work, labor saving and labor saving. (5) Information system Although our group has established an appropriate system management system, troubles in system operation may hinder business operations. (7) Fluctuations in crude oil prices In the processed foods business, fluctuations in crude oil prices affect the procurement costs of products, raw materials and fuels such as heavy oil. In addition, we are subject to the legal regulations of the country concerned in developing our overseas business. If the cost burden for responding to environmental law revisions, etc. increases significantly in the future, it may have a significant impact on the performance of the Group. (13) Ownership of fixed assets The Group owns many logistics centers and production plants that require large capital investment. With respect to these strategically held shares, we examine the medium- to long-term economic rationality of each issue and sell those shares that are judged to have little significance.

#### Analysis of financial status, business performance and cash flow status
<details><summary>summary</summary><div>
 (1) Outline of business performance, etc. and details of analysis and consideration regarding business performance, etc. from the perspective of management ① Status and analysis of business performance In the current Japanese economy, corporate performance and employment income environment will improve. Although the recovery trend continued moderately, weakness was seen in some exports and production toward the end of the fiscal year. In the food logistics industry, the increase in equipment due to the expansion of handling due to strong storage demand has become remarkable, while work costs, vehicle procurement costs, and electricity charges have increased. (Unit: million yen) Net sales Operating income (segment) YoY change (%) YoY change (%) Processed food 226,5885,9012.714,596230.2 Fisheries 71,245 △266 △0.4182 △122 △40.3 Livestock 91,0766830.81,45215011.6 Low temperature logistics 201,0495,9553.111,3981421.3 Real estate 4,794 △74 △1.52,096 △55 △2.6 Others 5,790 4458.3338 △473 △58.3 Adjustments △20,402 △535－△553 △51－Total 580, 14 112,109 2.129,511 △386 △1.3 (b) Processed foods business 《Industry topics》 In the processed foods industry, demand for easily prepared foods and demand for prepared meals such as prepared foods against the backdrop of an increase in single-person households and labor shortages. Remained strong. <Points of business performance> As a result of focusing on product development and sales activities centered on main categories such as processed chicken products and cooked rice for both home and commercial use, sales of home cooking products expanded and sales increased. Focusing on product development and sales activities that meet the needs of each business category, we are focusing on product development and sales activities that meet the needs of each business category, such as the “Chefs Specialties” series under the supervision of famous chefs. It has been extended. <Points of business performance> Sales decreased due to careful purchase and sales in consideration of profitability. (C) Livestock business <<Industry topics>> Domestic demand expanded, supported by solid meat consumption. In terms of profits, despite an increase in cargo handling costs, etc., profits increased due to continued promotion of measures such as business improvement and transportation efficiency. Overseas In Europe, there was a decrease in chicken import volume and an increase in transportation and delivery costs due to the problem of meat fraud in Brazil, but sales and profits increased due to the steady capture of transportation demand such as transportation operations for retail stores and the expansion of handling of imported fruit juice. It was. (E) Real estate business <Points of business performance> Although we sought to maintain and improve the occupancy rate by implementing renewal work to strengthen the competitiveness of rental office buildings, we completed the sale of residential lots in Ushiku City, Ibaraki Prefecture and some rental offices. Revenue and profit declined due to factors such as the acquisition of earthquake-resistant marks in buildings. (F) Other businesses <Points of business performance> Among other businesses, in the bioscience business, although sales of biopharmaceutical raw materials and rapid diagnostic agents were favorable and sales increased, a new production and R&D base was established ( Earnings declined due to a temporary cost burden resulting from the acquisition of a medical device company in Sayama City, Saitama Prefecture) and the United States. (2) Financial status and cash flow status and analysis, etc. (a) Financial status and analysis (Unit: million yen) Year-on-year comparison [Assets] Current assets 153,564 160,5546,989 Fixed assets 213 ,703 216,7032,999 (i) Total assets 367,268 377,2579,988 (Liabilities/Net assets) Current liabilities 110,48999,561 (10,927) Non-current liabilities 87,09893,8906,791 (ii) Total liabilities 197, 587 193,451 (4,135) Of which, interest-bearing debt (excluding lease obligations) 97,745 (79,844) 95,951 (78,923) (1,794 (-920) (iii) Total net assets 169,680 183,80514,124 (including equity) (162,729) ( 176,820) (14,090) D/E ratio (times) (excluding lease obligations) 0.6 (0.5) 0.5 (0.4) △0.1 (△0.0) (Note) D/E ratio calculation method: interest-bearing debt ÷ net assets (i) Total assets point 377.2 billion yen (increase of 9.9 billion yen) Current assets increased by 6.9 billion yen due to favorable sales and increase in trade receivables, and tangible due to capital investment aimed at expanding profit base of main business Fixed assets increased 2.6 billion yen. (Iii) Points of cash flow from financing activities Cash outflows from financing activities amounted to 9.0 billion yen due to dividend payments of 4.1 billion yen and repayment of interest-bearing debt. Estimates and judgments/assessments are made based on factors that are considered to be rational according to past results and circumstances, but actual results may differ due to the uncertainties peculiar to estimates. ..

Applying the technology of "no water supply humidification" installed in our room air conditioner "Urusara 7", the moisture contained in the room air is absorbed by the adsorbent material (desiccant element), and it remains as a gas with high humidity. By discharging it outdoors, dehumidification is possible without the need to discard water. Among commercial air conditioners, as the only new model of the store/office air conditioner "Sky Air", it is the only one in the industry that sets the temperature and dehumidification level at the same time to realize more comfort than ever "FIVE STAR ZEAS" The "Ass" series and the "Eco-ZEAS" series were released in April 2018. Compared with the conventional R-410A, HFC-32 has a lower global warming potential (GWP), is more energy efficient, and can reduce the amount of refrigerant charged, so the global warming effect of the refrigerant of this product is Achieve a 76% reduction. In Europe, with the demand for low GWP refrigerants increasing due to F gas regulations and energy saving regulations, we launched a non-inverter scroll chiller that adopted the refrigerant R32 in July 2018, ahead of the industry. Released in November 2018. For fluororesins and rubbers, we are conducting research on differentiating new products in automobiles, semiconductors, wires & cables (IT field), etc. by taking advantage of the heat resistance, chemical resistance, and dielectric properties that we are good at. (3) Other businesses In the hydraulic machinery field, we have realized the energy-saving performance and high functionality that cannot be achieved by conventional hydraulic systems by taking advantage of the hybrid hydraulic system, which is a product that combines hydraulic technology and inverter technology.

#### Business risks
<details><summary>## Summary</summary><div>The matters related to the future in the text are those judged by the Group as of the date of submission of the securities report (June 27, 2019). 1. Rapid changes in the global economy and economy (1) Economic conditions The demand for our products and services is strongly influenced by the economic conditions of the countries and regions that provide them. If there is a sudden change that exceeds the forecast, it may affect the performance and financial condition of the Group, such as the deterioration of business performance and the occurrence of opportunity loss. It is also envisioned that the focus of added value will shift from the performance of the car as hardware to the software, such as what kind of experience can be provided to customers, including car-related services. In addition, the Group may enter into derivative transactions for the purpose of avoiding foreign exchange fluctuation risk of foreign currency-denominated debt and debt, avoiding interest rate fluctuation risk of interest-bearing debt procured at variable interest rates, and avoiding commodity price fluctuation risk. However, in the event of an unexpected large-scale change in the market environment, there is a possibility that funding may not be achieved as initially planned, which could have a negative impact on the Group's business performance and financial condition. .. (5) Sales finance business risk The sales finance business is one of the important businesses of the Group. If the actual results differ from the assumptions, or if the assumptions are changed, the effects are cumulative and are regularly recognized in the future, which generally affects costs and liabilities recognized in future periods. Could give. However, due to unexpected changes in the environment, changes in the world's needs, and relative decline in development competitiveness, there is a possibility that the new technology may not be accepted by the customer, resulting in a negative impact on the Group's performance. May have a significant impact. However, the adoption of a new technology to propose higher added value, even if it has been thoroughly vetted, may later cause unexpected quality problems such as product liability and product recall. is there. In particular, the amount of CO2 emitted during the use of vehicles is significantly higher than the amount of emissions associated with corporate activities, and accounts for 80% or more of the total, so risks such as regulation due to climate change may occur (value Of the 216,351kton-CO2 CO2 emissions of the entire chain, 190,261kton-CO2 was emitted when the sold car was used. Through these efforts, the "Nissan Green Program 2022" aims to reduce CO2 emissions per new vehicle by 40% in four years. (8) Limitation of protection of intellectual assets The Group has technology and know-how that can differentiate it from products of other companies. (9) Securing excellent human resources The Group considers human resources to be the most important asset, recruits excellent human resources globally, and enhances human resource development and ensures fairness and transparency in order to fully demonstrate their capabilities. We are also putting effort into realizing an evaluation system. Meanwhile, from 2018 to 2019, the former representative director of the Company was indicted for violating the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (filing of false securities report) and the former representative director chairman violated the Companies Act (special offense). ) Was also charged. Temporarily, in the light of corporate social responsibility, it is the secondary and tertiary suppliers and sellers who have performed inappropriate acts, or those related to products distributed through sales routes other than those envisioned by the Group. However, if the Group itself pursues social responsibility and the content and promptness of the response are insufficient, it will adversely affect the social credibility and reputation of the Group, resulting in a decrease in sales, etc. May affect your business performance. However, if a large-scale earthquake that exceeds our expectations causes a large amount of damage and compels us to suspend operations, it could have a significant impact on the Group's business performance and financial condition. Following the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, various risks that were not previously assumed have become apparent. (3) Dependence on a specific supplier In order to procure higher quality and technology at a more competitive price, orders may be forced to be concentrated on a specific supplier. (4) Risks related to information systems Almost all operations of the Group rely on information systems, and systems and networks are becoming more complex and sophisticated year by year.

#### Analysis of financial status, business performance and cash flow status
<details><summary>summary</summary><div>
 1) Financial status and business performance Global demand for the current consolidated fiscal year decreased by 1.5% from the previous year to 92.09 million units. Operating income was 318.2 billion yen, a decrease of 256.6 billion yen (44.6%) from the previous consolidated fiscal year. In addition, as a result of a decrease in exchange rates related to cash and cash equivalents of ¥38.3 billion and an increase of ¥1.1 billion due to a change in the scope of consolidation, the balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the current consolidated fiscal year was the end of the previous consolidated fiscal year. It increased by 153.1 billion yen (12.7%) from the balance to 1,359.1 billion yen. b. Orders received Since the Group's order-made production is very small, the description of orders received is omitted. (2) Contents of analysis and consideration regarding the status of business performance from the viewpoint of management The contents of analysis and consideration regarding the status of business performance of the Group from the viewpoint of management are as follows, in principle based on the consolidated financial statements. It is an analysis. The important accounting policies adopted by the Group's consolidated financial statements are described in “Basic Matters for Preparing Consolidated Financial Statements” in the consolidated financial statements in Section 5 [Accounting Status]. We believe that significant accounting policies have a significant impact on the judgment of significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements. In the future, if a customer's financial condition deteriorates and its solvency declines, additional provisions or credit losses may occur. Operating profit for the previous consolidated fiscal year decreased by 256.6 billion yen (44.6%). In the automobile business, sales (including internal sales between segments) were 10,584.1 billion yen, a decrease of 443.8 billion yen (4.0%) from the previous consolidated fiscal year. The main profit-decreasing factors were a decrease in the number of vehicles sold and an increase in development costs, despite an increase in profits due to a reduction in purchasing costs. Operating income was 72.1 billion yen, a decrease of 128.0 billion yen (64.0%) from the previous consolidated fiscal year. c. Europe Overall demand in the European market increased by 0.3% from the previous year to 20.03 million units, but the number of vehicles sold by the Group in the European markets excluding Russia decreased by 17.8% to 530,000 due to environmental regulations. The market share was 6,000 units, down 0.6 points from the previous year to 3.0%. Unit sales in the Latin American market were favorable, increasing by 8.1% to 225,000 units, and sales in the African markets such as South Africa increased by 6.1% to 101,000 units. Investment activities Expenditures for investment activities were 1,133.5 billion yen, a decrease of 14.2 billion yen from 1,143.7 billion yen in the previous consolidated fiscal year. This was mainly due to a decrease in income from issuance of corporate bonds. The Group's financial policy is to secure appropriate funds, maintain optimal liquidity, and maintain a sound balance sheet in order to invest in research and development activities, capital investment and financial operations.
