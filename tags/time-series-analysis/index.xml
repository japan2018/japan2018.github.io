      <description>## tl;dr   I made a muscle training estimation app Qore uses an algorithm called reservoir computing Performed a task of classifying time series data from acceleration data that can be acquired with a smartphone -Code Pretty good -99.6% accuracy with test data This should make you a muscle engineer  Strategy  Collect accelerometer data with a smartphone (iphone) Time series data with three components on the x, y and z axes is available Learn with 4 types of muscle training: push-ups, abs, squats, abs You can tell what kind of muscle training you did with only your smartphone  Data collection   Do your muscle workout with your smartphone in your pants pocket -This time, in any muscle training, put the smartphone in the pocket in the same direction -It seems that it will be more difficult to estimate if it is set in a different direction</description>
