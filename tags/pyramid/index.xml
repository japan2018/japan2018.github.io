      <description>https://github.com/YukiMiyatake/YukiMiyatakeWorks/tree/prj/Python/Pyramid/main  Leave notes on this branch
I had never done the front desk, but suddenly I was in charge of the front desk and the web server. I needed to create a new Python Pyramid that I&amp;rsquo;ve never used before Leave a note (although now) Generally, this is how I proceeded when I first worked on a language framework Itâ€™s a real language acquisition
First of all, this time I will go back and forth between both Windows and Mac PCs I have set up both PCs I made a Docker image, but basically I will run Python natively Editor is stable VS Code</description>
