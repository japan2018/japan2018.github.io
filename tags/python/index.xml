      <description>#1.Introduction  ##(1. Purpose If you want to do machine learning, anyone can use scikit-learn etc. to implement it relatively easily. However, in order to achieve results at work or to improve your level, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand the background, but I got this result&amp;rdquo; I think it&amp;rsquo;s clearly weak.
This time, we will focus on &amp;ldquo;correlation&amp;rdquo;**.
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about decorrelation, why do you do it?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;How do you use it?</description>

      <description>#Introduction  The productivity and soundness of a software development team can be understood as an internal sensation, but it is difficult for an external person to see it. This information asymmetry has caused problems in relationships with people outside the development team.
Also, for EMs, CTOs that bundle multiple development teams and products, and visualizing each situation with objective numbers and graphs, it is important reference information when considering the overall strategy.</description>

      <description>## Introduction-What is satellite data-   Artificial satellite data refers to data acquired by &amp;ldquo;remote sensing&amp;rdquo; using artificial satellites. Until now, satellite data required specialized tools and a large-capacity data processing platform, so the available organizations were limited to university institutions and some specialized institutions, but the spread of open source libraries and data By using the processing infrastructure cloud, an external environment has been set up in which general organizations can easily handle satellite data.</description>

      <description>#Let&#39;s explain about Othello class 2  Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about types There are blood types, right? Type A, Type B, Type O, Type AB, etc. Whether it is true or not, aside from the fact that it is &amp;ldquo;A type that is well-organized&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;B type that is selfish&amp;rdquo;, the type has its own characteristics. In programming, types are used to make such important divisions as blood types.
Until now, I have explained various things about variables, but I have not touched on types.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  Are you using Python&amp;rsquo;s Type Hints? Since Python is a dynamically typed language, some may find it advantageous to be able to code without explicitly adding type information. The opinion is correct, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s also true that you can make the coding more bug-free by specifying the type explicitly. This article covers introductory to intermediate types of Python types. We hope you helped improve your Python skills.</description>

Goal this time For the time being, I would like to easily make something like a web application. The most difficult part in creating a web application is the processing of the back end and the creation of HTML files, but Streamlit seems to have no need to do those tasks at all. You can make a web page with just one Python file.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  When analyzing data, I think you will visualize the data using graphs. At that time, it would be convenient if the statistics showing the correlation between two variables could be displayed at the same time. Therefore, we made it possible to display the appropriate statistics on the appropriate graph according to the content of the variable (category or numerical value).
Review so far I will summarize the appropriate graphing methods by content of variables and the statistics that show the correlation, which have been described so far.</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s why we decided to challenge kaggle&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;House Price&amp;rdquo; problem, which is a famous title. So, if you make a note of this properly, it will be useful for later, so I decided to post it to qiita after reading the line by line.</description>

I hope it will be a reference for beginners.
What is reinforcement learning? The position of reinforcement learning is like this.
【the term】 - Supervised learning - Input and output as teacher data - Regression and classification problems - Unsupervised learning - No teacher data - Extract data features and transform expressions What we will do in reinforcement learning is We will “learn behaviors that maximize future value”.</description>

YouDev is a service that focuses on individual developers to let them know more about them (I want to know&amp;hellip;).

      <description>When drawing a map with cartopy 0.18.0 or earlier, there were problems such as the axis labels only supporting equirectangular projection and UTM projection, and the axis label format being questionable. I wrote [this article](https://qiita.com/earth06/items/f5958a89a546dce00c36) about the adjustment of the axis label, but since the adjustment function around the axis of the cartopy has been significantly strengthened, the axis is very simple. You can now write labels.  In this article, we will plot the map with adjusted axis labels using the latest features of cartopy.</description>

      <description>There was a noise removal method that I was convinced that there is a method like this in the kaggle kernel (notebook now), so I will summarize the things I examined about it below with notes.  Method overview An analysis method for a certain signal or waveform is called wavelet transform. I think that I often imagine the Fourier transform as an analysis method, but the Fourier transform expands the waveform to the sum of trigonometric functions (Sain, Kosain), whereas the wavelet transform decomposes it into a waveform of any shape.</description>

We are developing a morphological analysis library called konoha. We have implemented the AllenNLP integration for this library, so this time we will introduce it. By using this function, Japanese text can be passed to the allennlp train command without any preprocessing such as segmentation.
AllenNLP AllenNLP is a natural language processing library developed by Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. AllenNLp is a very powerful tool, but if you want to handle Japanese data, it may be necessary to perform pre-processing that performs morphological analysis beforehand.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  I bought a Razz pie, thinking that I might find a new hobby indoors during lockdown. I wondered if it would be useful for experiments later if I could control the motor, so I bought a stepper motor together, so I will control it. It is interesting just to rotate it at a constant speed, but the goal was to be able to do arbitrary movements. I started from almost zero knowledge of electric and electronic circuits, but it was easy to do because various information was dropped on the net.</description>

      <description>Hi, this is [Muscle Training Clinical Engineering Engineer ken](https://twitter.com/ce_fitness_note).  This is my first post on Qiita.
I usually use C# to develop medical systems. I decided to focus on machine learning, so I started learning python.
Even though I learned about it, I went around Progate&amp;rsquo;s python course, but I will briefly summarize the differences between C# and how to write.
If you usually use C#, C++, VB and want to learn python from now on, I think that learning will be better if you know the difference between the two in advance.</description>

      <description>## debug() instead of print()  Although print() is the output method used in Python, in TouchDesigner you can use the function debug() instead of where print() is available. The debug() can see the output as well as where and on which line of which operator it was called. This is useful in most cases when debugging with Touch Designer.

      <description>I will introduce the python grammar that you may be able to do a drooling face if you know mainly new features.  1. Assignment expression New syntax added from python3.8. It&amp;rsquo;s good to know something new. An assignment expression can be written with the syntax :=, and conditional expressions and assignment statements can be used at the same time.
For example, the following common conditional expressions
text =&amp;#39;Hello New Expression!</description>

      <description>## Variables may not be value entities  When dealing with specific types such as list and dictionary, variables refer to entities, rather than value entities. The properties of variables can be confirmed from the execution results of the following programs.
l1 = [] l1.append(0) l2 = l1 l2.append(1) print(&amp;#39;l1 =&amp;#39;,l1) print(&amp;#39;l2 =&amp;#39;,l2) Execution result
 l1 = [0, 1] l2 = [0, 1]
 After assigning the list l1 to the list l2, the value was added only to l2, but the same value is added to l1.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  I am currently a M2 student majoring in CS. I usually write machine learning code in PyTorch. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to write for the time being. PyTorch is said to be &amp;ldquo;Define by Run&amp;rdquo;**, and what is good at the same time when the calculation graph and data are sent is that it is easy to debug because you can check the calculation results on the way. As a PyTorch believer, I need to write code in TensorFlow this time, so I will keep a memo so that I don&amp;rsquo;t forget the know-how at that time.</description>

You can tune and predict from preprocessing without writing 10 lines of code! Although there are many parts that I have not understood yet such as arguments, I decided to write the article of PyCaret first. If you have any notes, please comment.

#Conclusion
Just give the path of the directory you want to display as a tree to the following function. Since it is implemented for Mac, it is not supported when paths are not separated by slashes.
import pathlib import glob import os def tree(path, layer=0, is_last=False, indent_current=&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;): if not pathlib.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  The elements that make up a self-driving car in the real world are vehicle position estimation, object recognition, action judgment, and vehicle body control. It is possible to implement all four of these elements on the basis of radio control, but it is not easy to easily estimate the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s position, and this time the target is low-speed driving, so there is almost no need for body control. Therefore, this time, I would like to use an ultrasonic distance sensor to recognize an object in front of me and make a simple action decision to avoid it with a radio-controlled robot car that operates automatically.</description>

      <description>I recently researched the point spread function (PSF), which often appears in the context of lens design, and the specific numerical calculation method for MTF curves, so I summarized them. I&#39;m not an expert in lens design, and I&#39;m not from a physics department, so I&#39;m afraid there are some mistakes, but I&#39;d appreciate it if anyone noticed.  About point spread function (PSF) Point spread function (PSF) is a function that represents the intensity distribution of light on the image plane when a point light source forms an image on the image plane.</description>

      <description>When I was talking about Python coding standards with a friend, I suddenly said, &amp;quot;Why some libraries ([`logging`](https://docs.python.org/ja/3/library/logging.html)etc.) does camelCase have been adopted?”  #logging example code. The method name such as getLogger is camelCase. import logging logger = logging.getLogger(&amp;#39;simple_example&amp;#39;) logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG) In fact, PEP8 &amp;ldquo;Function and variable names&amp;rdquo; says:
 Function names should be in lower case only. Also, for readability, words should be separated by underscores as needed.
The names of variables follow the same convention as functions.</description>

      <description>Hello. This is my first post.  The other day, when I went to Saizeriya, the waiting time was about 20 minutes, and I was looking for a mistake in Saizeriya, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it&amp;hellip; So I thought I could solve it with image processing, so I tried it. It was also a good study of OpenCV.

      <description>This is a reminder of what I checked when converting the Python argparse settings to hydra.  Finally, I wrote a convenient function that only hydra has.
Introduction When writing an experiment script for machine learning in python, argparse was used as a setting method for hyperparameters. However, as the experiment became more complicated, there was a desire to have a considerable number of lines in the file that describes the setting of argparse and to structure the setting.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  It&amp;rsquo;s been a month since I started studying deep learning.
I thought I could understand the basics, so I wondered if I could do something.
Then, suddenly, I came up with an estimate of the ranking of this boat race.
I was not convinced that I could predict the rank, but I knew that open source of boat race data was open to the public, so I thought I had to try this.</description>

      <description># Motivation for this article #  Last year, I changed jobs from a production engineering job to a data analysis job, and I have more opportunities to write Python. I am currently involved in a project to develop a preprocessing tool for machine learning. Meanwhile, looking back when I was working as a production engineer, I thought that there were various tasks that could be automated . Based on the knowledge of Python obtained after changing jobs and the knowledge of the days of production engineers, I will describe the material that can be used when working again at the manufacturing site.</description>

#Introduction I am currently a graduate student with a 2nd year master&amp;rsquo;s degree. I am studying the Martian atmosphere using numerical simulation. Since I mainly analyzed the results obtained by numerical simulation using Python, I tried to summarize all the functions used in the process. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list. .. .. However, since I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling to use the documentation, I&amp;rsquo;ve summarized it in the hope that if anyone using Python&amp;rsquo;s visualization tools can help with that!</description>

      <description>Nice to meet you.  I am a beginner who was introduced to competitive professionals last week. I&amp;rsquo;m using python now.
If possible, I want to get good results in competitive professionals without resorting to C++! So I thought about how to increase the score with python.
For example in C++
#define rep(i,n) for((i)=0;(i)&amp;lt;(int)(n);(i)++) There are many people who speed up like this. In short, I feel like simplifying the frequently used descriptions.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  *A revised version has been created. https://qiita.com/Fumio-eisan/items/10c54af7a925b403f59f
I am working in the manufacturing industry, but I feel the flow of actively introducing IoT and AI technologies. I do not belong to the system department that mainly handles these technologies. However, I want to feel the flow myself! I think. There is a Raspberry Pi as a tool that is relatively easy to handle, so I am tentatively planning what can be done with this.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  The number of people infected with the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) spread from China to the world, and as of March 14, 2020, the number of infected people was 145,637 and 5,436 dead, which is a very high number. However, looking at the situation in Japan, the number of infected people was 734, 9.1% of Korea&amp;rsquo;s 8086 and 4.2% of Italy&amp;rsquo;s 17,660. It has been pointed out that the reason for this apparent difference is that Japan is limiting the number of PCR tests.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  Perhaps recently, a feature called GitHub Actions has been added. This is the one that can fire certain Actions (shell script executions) for certain events. For example, it is a function for so-called CI/CD that builds when PR of dev branch is merged and pushes it to dev-pages branch.
At this time, I participated in the COVID-19 countermeasure site Hokkaido version, which is currently a big move, and developed using this function.</description>

      <guid>https://memotut.com/pytorch-dataloader-is-slow-98cb0/</guid>
      <description>In PyTorch, DataLoader(`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`) is often used to extract a mini-batch from a dataset, but when experimenting with large size data, using PyTorch&#39;s DataLoader It turns out to be very time consuming. For comparison, I made and tried an iterator that retrieves mini-batches from a dataset, but I found that Pytorch&#39;s DataLoader was much slower. In particular, this can be a bottleneck when using large size data.  [Postscript: 2020/03/23] We received a comment that the slow cause is BatchSampler used by default in DataLoader.</description>

(2020/03/12) I teach programming at school. I made a text of PySimple GUI for use in educational settings.
There are many GUI libraries for Python, but PySimpleGUI is probably the easiest for beginners. There is a sense of security that it is based on Tkinter.

The new corona pneumonia (Covid-19) that occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China from December 2019 has spread to Japan and the number of infected people is increasing. I am interested in how the number of infected people in Japan will increase in the future. Therefore, I searched for articles on infection prediction models. Infection models have already been announced from all over the world, but parameters such as the infection rate and the isolation rate greatly affect the accuracy when predicting with an infection model.</description>

      <guid>https://memotut.com/python-article-that-enables-high-speed-sparse-matrix-calculation-e5500/</guid>
      <description>#Introduction  **A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements of the matrix are 0. It is used in a wide range of fields such as numerical calculation, machine learning, and graph theory (I think). Since most of the matrix is 0, if you devise to ignore 0, you can perform matrix calculation at high speed. For example, if you use a large-scale sparse matrix (nearly 90% is 0) (1 million rows x 1 million columns) and only use non-zero parts, the calculation time will be about 1/10 and the calculation can be completed quickly.</description>

      <description># threading and multiprocessing  Speaking of the main modern OS, there are Mac OS, UNIX, Linux, Windows, etc. These operating systems support &amp;ldquo;multitasking&amp;rdquo; functionality.
What is multitasking? You might think that, for example, in the situation of launching a browser, listening to music, and writing a report in Word, at least three tasks are in progress at the same time. And in addition to the tasks in the table, various OS-related tasks are secretly running behind the scenes.</description>

      <description>#### Introduction  At a certain point, I found the following &amp;ldquo;Problems of liars and honests&amp;rdquo;. I was interested, so I tried programming with Python.
  There were 4 people in a village, A, B, C, and D. Two of them are known to be liars, and two of these are known to be honest. Liars always lie and honests always answer honestly. They are logical and there are no mistakes.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a commentary or my own study.
I mainly write &amp;ldquo;small numerical values&amp;rdquo;. If you make a mistake, throw Masakari.

If you&amp;rsquo;ve heard it but don&amp;rsquo;t know it, this article will help you understand it.
#What is UMAP
It is a method to reduce and visualize dimensions faster and with higher performance than t-SNE. Compare with the commonly used t-SNE. The following figure is a visualization of Fashion MNIST.
(From Understanding UMAP)
Compared to t-SNE, UMAP seems to have distinct clusters. Similar categories are placed near each other and dissimilar categories are placed far away.</description>

      <description>Recently, I often talk about talk about wanting to automatically determine the threshold, so I summarized it.  Threshold design corresponds to two-dimensional unsupervised clustering of two groups. Yes. This time, we will summarize 5 classical and useful methods, taking image binarization as an example.
Note: If the distribution system is unknown, there is no correct answer for threshold determination

      <description>#Introduction  This time, I studied Doc2Vec as an extension of Word2Vec. &amp;ldquo;Document classification&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;document grouping (clustering)&amp;rdquo; are tasks that are often requested in natural language processing, but in order to implement them, a distributed representation of the document itself is required. If you use Doc2Vec, you can directly get the distributed representation.
##reference I have referred to the following to understand Doc2Vec.

      <description>Since the IOT became popular, efforts have been made to increase the number of sensors in order to predictively maintain machinery.  Is being done.
Rumor has it that there are cases where 100 sensors are attached to one machine.
The question is, is it justified to increase the number of sensors? In other words, does **adding extra sensors not affect the anomaly detection performance? When That is it.
In this paper, we focus on the curse of dimension, “When we increase the number of extra sensors, we detect anomalies.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  In distance learning (metric learning) using deep learning, similarities (and dissimilarities) between images are used by using Contrastive Loss and Triplet Loss.) Is widely used, but it is also known that it is difficult to combine and select learning data, and learning itself is difficult in many cases. For that reason, various improvements and ideas have been proposed so far. However, recently, metric learning, which can learn based on the Softmax function as if it is a general class classification task without the difficulty of selecting learning data like this, has been attracting attention.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  I decided to give a Lightning Talk about Python at work, so I&amp;rsquo;ll write something that can be read in about 5 minutes. The talk theme is &amp;ldquo;Knowledge when trying to speed up in Python&amp;rdquo;. **This isn&amp;rsquo;t an article about Python. **
Target of this article This article is for the following people:
 Python beginner People who are interested in Python but think that it seems not to be speed  Immediate conclusion As the title says, don&amp;rsquo;t write Python (as much as possible) if you want to speed it up.</description>

      <description>Recently, new pneumonia has become popular.  Since I had previously conducted a study using a mathematical model of infectious disease called SIR model, I applied it to a new model of pneumonia. Mathematical models can be used to predict the future of infectious diseases.
This time, we focus on Wuhan*** Hubei Province*** (provinces including Wuhan), which is the center of the outbreak, to model infectious diseases and predict the future of infectious diseases.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  I thought it would be a good idea to do a patent analysis, so I decided to give it a try. Specifically, for patent analysis, for example, there is the following plot. (The figure is quoted from J-STORE Manual) The vertical axis shows the patent applicant, the horizontal axis shows the year the patent was issued, and the size of the circle shows the number of patents. This is called the bubble chart.</description>

 You can use this formula to find an approximate value for $\pi$.  Calculating $\sum_{n=1}^{a}\frac{1}{n^2}$ using $1$ as an integer from 1 to $1$ $\times6$ for the answer obtained in 2.1 Calculate the square root of the answer obtained in 3.2. This value is an approximation of $\pi$.  So I implemented it in python. Code is omitted.

      <description>Do you all know Wear?  WEAR is a fashion coordination site and one of our services. In short, it is an SNS where you can share your fashion coordination.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but it seems to be popular to post with the face hidden by an icon. Is it because people without a face can see the coordination objectively?
However, the face hiding work is surprisingly troublesome, and I wish I could automate this&amp;hellip; so I implemented a program for automatic icon placement.</description>

      <description>At work I had to do image processing using Python. It&#39;s okay if it can be done by OpenCV etc., but the filter of the original algorithm will not be practical unless it is C/C++. So I made a module for Python in C language.  If you want to try it out quickly, please use my repository. https://github.com/soramimi/pymodule-image-filter
How to make your own module for Python Install dependent modules The first trial is helloworld, so it is not necessary, but numpy, pillow, and matplotlib are used in the later image processing section, so these modules must be installed.</description>

      <guid>https://memotut.com/python-naming-convention-since-pep8-bc3bd/</guid>
      <description>Python has &amp;quot;[PEP8: Python code style guide](https://pep8-ja.readthedocs.io/ja/latest/)&amp;quot;, which also describes naming conventions such as variable names and function names.  By matching the naming convention and coding style, you can reduce the burden on people who read the source code and those who review it. Please refer not only to the naming convention but also to the naming method described in &amp;ldquo;Readable Code&amp;rdquo;.
PEP8    Usage Naming Convention     Private, private One underscore at the beginning   Name collision avoidance in subclasses Two underscores at the beginning   Special property, special method Add two underscores before and after (Because it is prepared in the language specification, do not define it yourself)   Collision avoidance with reserved words and built-in function names Last one underscore       Usage Naming Convention     Package Short names in all lowercase, no underscores   Module All names in lowercase, separated by underscores   Classes, exceptions CapWords method (connect uppercase words only at the beginning, do not use underscore)   Function, Method Lowercase letters only, with words separated by underscores   Constant Uppercase letters only, words separated by underscores   Variable lowercase only, with words separated by underscores if necessary   1-character variable Never use l (lowercase ell), O (uppercase O), I (uppercase eye) (depending on the font the numbers 1, 0 (I can&amp;rsquo;t tell that))    Other than PEP8    Usage Naming Convention     Discard variable 1 underscore (when a variable is needed but not used in a for loop or split assignment)    Reedable code  Don&amp;rsquo;t abbreviate words (Obviously omitted names are OK) Information and meaning can be added to the name (flag and check do not know what flag or what value was checked) Communicate information by name so that no comment is required Use single-character variables for temporary variables that can be used within the viewable range (up to 25 lines)  Such.</description>

      <description>First of all, since I often use tree-structured recursion as a tree information source, decision tree algorithm, etc., I would like to summarize recursive functions.  A function that executes itself is called a recursive function, and the place of execution within itself of a recursive function is called a recursive call.
def recursive_f(depth): print(&amp;quot;depth: &amp;quot;+ str(depth)) if depth == 10: return recursive_f(depth + 1) if __name__==&amp;quot;__main__&amp;quot;: recursive_f(0) The execution result will be as follows.</description>

      <description>When ``0.1`` is substituted for ``x`` and displayed on the console, ``0.1`` is displayed.  x = 0.1 print(x) # =&amp;gt; 0.1 It seems obvious, but 0.1 cannot be represented exactly in floating point numbers (IEEE 754). However, it is strange that print is displayed when doing print. I write down what I learned about this.

      <description>Many people are willing to omit `__init__.py` from Python 3.3, but don&#39;t omit it. **  Why the misunderstanding happened Implicit namespace package was added in PEP 420 from Python 3.3.
**Namespace package is not an ordinary package. ** It&amp;rsquo;s a special purpose thing, and for most people ** it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even need to know.
If you really want to know, read PEP 420 above and the packaging guide.

With Python, you can easily get Realsense images and depth information.
It is very convenient when you want to acquire depth information after image recognition by deep learning using Python with Realsense.
If you have an X86 PC, you can easily install it with pip install pyrealsense, but with the Jetson Nano from Arm, you need to devise it, so I will briefly explain how to set it up and how to use it.</description>

      <description>As a material for learning GoF design patterns, the book &amp;quot;[Expanded and Revised Edition Introduction to Design Patterns in Java Language](https://www.hyuki.com/dp/)&amp;quot; seems to be helpful. However, since the examples taken up are JAVA-based, I tried a similar practice in Python to deepen my understanding.  ■ Singleton The Singleton pattern (singleton pattern) is one of the design patterns in an object-oriented computer program. Defined by the GoF (Gang of Four). The Singleton pattern is a design pattern that guarantees that only one instance of the class will be created.</description>

Or, there are many things we do for &amp;ldquo;too clear sound sources&amp;rdquo; such as news videos. The Blog that buzzed about Amazon Transcribe also tells highly accurate transcriptions in English. It is well known that English is highly accurate in the field of natural language processing, but I am worried about how it is Japanese.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m not good at imagining a 3D array of numpy with my head, where does axis=1 point? Like so every time, I will summarize my own understanding. Below, &amp;quot;array&amp;quot; refers to np.array.  Trigger In “Essence of Machine Learning” (Author: Koichi Kato), when there is a two-dimensional array X with seven two-dimensional vectors and a two-dimensional array cluster_centers with three two-dimensional vectors, the distance between the two vectors is squared. The calculation for brute force was done as follows (extracted from the third edition pp.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  It is convenient to be able to debug with software alone when measuring temperature with Raspberry Pi and acquiring sensor status with GPIO. Therefore, we created a debug environment that simulates temperature measurement and acquisition of sensor status with GPIO, and displays it on a website (created with Flask). Save the simulated temperature and sensor state in SQLite and refresh the page via Ajax. The temperature and sensor values are hard to understand, so it looks as if the living room temperature and sensor had changed.</description>

      <description>I went to issue (reissue) a commuter pass for commuting at the beginning of the year.  Great queue. .. ..
What is this? Disneyland-like.
I write the same thing every time. Line up. Troublesome.
This means that if you issue a QR code once and hold each with your smartphone, you can improve efficiency considerably. ?
First, install the module for creating QR code with pip.

      <description>## Transcription accuracy is lower than expected  As I mentioned at the end of the previous article that summarized How to use Google Speech API, I encountered a problem that the character recognition accuracy is lower than I expected. It was.
It seems that about 80% can be transcribed in rebuild.fm, but in my case not even half recognized by experience It&amp;rsquo;s an impression. Even though it wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, I was hoping that reading the transcribed text would give me a sense of what the conversation was about, but it was pretty devastating.</description>

      <description>This post is the 25th day of &amp;quot;Natural Language Processing Advent Calendar 2019-Qiita&amp;quot;.  siny.
In this article, I summarized the creation of a negative-positive classifier using BERT, which plays a major role in natural language processing in 2019.
#Introduction I think that knowledge about BERT has appeared in books, blogs, Qiita, etc. However, since most datasets that can be used for natural language processing are based on English, and there are not many Japanese datasets, it is quite difficult to use BERT using Japanese text.</description>

      <description>This article is from [Furukawa Lab, Advent_calendar Day 23](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/flab).  #Introduction
GPLVM is an unsupervised learning method that uses Gaussian process (GP) and can estimate low-dimensional manifolds whose data are distributed in high-dimensional space. The main attraction of GPLVM is that the model is very simple and highly expandable, and theoretically easy to handle. In fact, it has been extended to more complex situations such as Bayesian estimation of hyperparameters, time series data analysis 1, multiview analysis 2, and tensor decomposition 3.</description>

But when I cheered up, the model doesn&amp;rsquo;t do its best, and there is no dramatic development, so it&amp;rsquo;s a waste of time to look at it.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone.  I started Qiita from today.
As a machine learning engineer, I am usually involved in AI development and web application development.
In private, I became a newbie daddy. I am writing an article while holding my eldest son who will be 4 months (laugh)
As a motivation to write an article, I have been working on machine learning since 2017 when there was no reference book yet, I always feel that the experience of having a hard time learning machine learning is useful for someone.</description>

      <description># Python program is slow! I want to speed up! At that time...  When implemented in Python, the processing time may be too long to meet the requirements. In that case, there are four types of measures shown in this article.
If you do something to speed it up, you lose something else. Typical examples of trade-offs are freedom of expression, readability, dependency, memory usage, and CPU usage. Please follow the usage and capacity and use correctly.</description>

      <description>This is the 23rd day article of [Blender Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/blender).  When creating Blender scripts and add-ons, you will often edit the source code using a text editor. One of the advantages of using a text editor is the efficiency of development by the code completion function, but as part of the Python API provided by Blender is provided as binary data instead of Python source code, it remains as is.</description>

      <description>When implementing Kafka consumer, we often use languages such as Java and Scala, but I would like to use Python, which can be implemented lightly if it is not that complicated.  This time I&amp;rsquo;d like to write a maintenance process that moves the offset of one consumer to another consumer using kafka-python of Apache Kafka library for Python.
Consumer offset acquisition This time we will use KafkaAdminClient. You can also get it from KafkaConsumer, but it is complicated to subscribe or poll the consumer, so it is recommended to use this client.</description>

A brief overview In this article, I will explain how to analyze sentiment by natural language processing the text of the novel **&amp;ldquo;Weather Child&amp;rdquo;**!
In general, emotional analysis is to discover and quantify &amp;ldquo;emotion&amp;rdquo; contained in a sentence and judge the opinion of the sentence. This is an area of current interest because it allows us to mechanically categorize user opinions about our products and services.
On the other hand, &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it possible to use sentiment analysis in addition to reviews and reviews?</description>

      <link>https://memotut.com/roughly-speed-up-python-with-numba-9d223/</link>

      <guid>https://memotut.com/roughly-speed-up-python-with-numba-9d223/</guid>
      <description>A library called [numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) can speed up Python code relatively easily.  Hopefully you can speed it up by writing from numba import jit and writing @jit in the line before the function you want to speed up.
As a mechanism, numba seems to get the virtual machine code of Python, compile it into LLVM IR, and make it native code using LLVM. At the first execution, the compile process runs, so it will be slightly slower, but if it is a heavy process, numba may be faster from the viewpoint of compile time.</description>

In this article, I will implement the &amp;ldquo;algorithm for determining whether the world is inconsistent when given a political party name&amp;rdquo; in Python, which was asked in the original article.
Formulate mathematically If NHK is 0 and the people are 1, the “party protecting the people from NHK” can be expressed as the “party protecting 0 to 1”.</description>

      <description># TL;DR  The impression that I rewrote the MNIST code of Chainer to PyTorch was almost the same. The difference was in the layer above Updater in Chainer and the Ignite layer in PyTorch. Moreover, when chainer-pytorch-migration is actually used, Extensions used in Chainer can also be used in Ignite, and PyTorch+Ignite can be used quite like Chainer. I think that even people who have been using Chainer can naturally get used to PyTorch+Ignite.</description>

      <description>## [Introduction]  This article will be on the 19th day of How I learned machine learning by Nikkei xTECH Business AI ② Advent Calendar 2019.
Here is how my uncle SE studied machine learning. The motivation was to start with the question, &amp;ldquo;Can you use machine learning?&amp;rdquo; Since I was working in the dark clouds, my honest memory is vague.
career I have been programming for nearly 30 years. Starting with MS BASIC I learned when I was in elementary school, I have touched Z80 assembler, MC68000 assembler, FORTRAN, C (UNIX), C++ (Mac), VB, Java (Android), VB.</description>

      <description>This article is the 12/20 article of [Sumzap Advent Calendar 2019 #1](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/sumzap1).  What is # Airtest
https://airtest.netease.com/ Cross platform UI automation IDE developed and published by NetEase. Here we will refer to the generic name of IDEs and projects for automated testing of mobile applications that use image recognition. By using this, you can create test code without knowing the code on the project directly. You can mass-produce the test as if it were an E2E test, or repeat the same action endlessly as an aging test.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Recently, the development of natural language processing technology has been remarkable and is being applied in various fields. Although I often do business using natural language processing technology and AI, the most troublesome (but important) work is related to various preprocessing.
The main pre-processing that you will perform for most tasks are:
 Cleaning  Removes noise in text such as HTML tags and symbols   Normalization  Full-width/half-width and unification of capital letters and small letters   ** sentence segmentation **  Detects sentence breaks and splits   Wordization  Split sentence into a sequence of words   Remove stopword  Remove unnecessary words for the task you want to solve    I mainly use Python, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a suitable library for ** Japanese sentence breaks **, and I had to write similar code every time.</description>

      <description>Hello. I&#39;m a software engineer who makes various embedded systems, games, web apps, iOS apps, signage control systems, etc.  About two and a half years ago, I thought that I should write in Python as a general-purpose scripting language that is difficult to realize only with a shell, and I was trying to learn Python while suffering. Since I only use it occasionally, I was at a level where I forget how to write if and for loops every time.</description>

      <description>It is no exaggeration to say that the modern information society is supported by cryptographic technology. Nevertheless, we are reaping the benefits without being particularly aware of cryptography. What&#39;s more, cryptography has been around for a long time, as it existed around 100 BC. In addition, Hyundai Cryptography is trying to ensure high security by making full use of advanced mathematics, and eventually it will be derived from blockchain technology.

      <description>~~MCMC should be done! Onegacious without the tsukkomi  As you know, many probability density functions are predefined in scipy, and by using them, you can easily perform sampling and plotting of probability density functions.
For example,
stats.norm.rvs(loc=50, scale=20, size=1000) Then you can get 1000 samples from a normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation 20, and
x = np.linspace(0, 100, 100) px = stats.norm.pdf(x, loc=50, scale=20) plt.plot(x, px) Then we can also plot the normal distribution at $0&amp;lt;x&amp;lt;100$.</description>

      <description># Overview  This article is the 14th day of Future Advent Calendar 2019. Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s article was written by @RuyPKG I want to have fun even with newcomers! ~Preparation of minutes~.
@Shibukawa introduced the game engine at an in-house study session the other day, which is the reason why this article was written. I wanted a UI for a board game implemented in Python, and it was difficult to express movement in HTML, so I decided to try pygame, the Python game engine.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Many data structures provide destructive operations. Arrays, for example, offer the ability to update one element with another. The processing time of the array update operation is excellent in that it does not depend on the length or value of the array. On the other hand, there are times when you want to perform non-destructive operations on data structures. For example, in each calculation of reduce/fold processing (convolution operation) that uses an array as a cumulative value, a new array should be generated nondestructively (it is possible to use the array after destruction as the calculation result, but Is hard to say).</description>

      <description># 0. Introduction  I think that deep learning frameworks are all areas where development is very fast and exciting. While there are TensorFlow, jax, etc., there is also PFN Newstheotherday,andPyTorchislikelytobemoresolid.PerhapstherewillbemorePyTorchusersinthefuture(IwillnotmentionthisarticleiftheofficialTraineralsofoundinChainerisimplementedinPyTorch,whichthreatenstheexistenceofthisarticle).
However, while PyTorch has a high degree of freedom, the code around learning (such as around the loop of each epoch) is left to the individual, and tends to be very individual code.
Writing these codes myself is a lot of learning, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s a must if you start PyTorch.</description>

      <description>I had been writing TypeScript for about a year, but I started to work on Python3 for about a month.  Although Python is simple and fun, there are places that I inherited from other people, and it is hard to develop and have no type.
The hardest part is reading the code, and what does this function return? Do not know at first glance what this variable contains. &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;There is no type as a document.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  In recent years, I often hear the word ~~ as a Service such as IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service) in IT area. Here, I would like to collectively call them [A-Z]aaS. I think that there are increasing opportunities to listen to various [A-Z]aaS such as BaaS (Backend as a Service) such as Firebase and FaaS (Function as a Service) such as AWS Lambda.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Feedback control has been used to “control” everything from home appliances to industrial equipment. A device that performs this control is called a controller, and various design methods have been considered. This time, I would like to introduce a relatively new approach called &amp;ldquo;data-driven controller design method&amp;rdquo;.
I will leave the theoretical part to the paper and write it focusing on the use. So, I&amp;rsquo;d like to explain it while mixing the code of MATLAB and Python.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  Hello. Promptly, is the source code you wrote easy to read?
There are many opportunities for others to see my own code, such as when co-developed by multiple people, when it is published on the Internet, when it is delivered, and so on. If the code you write at such times is well-formatted, not only the reader but also the reader will be able to understand the code quickly and without misunderstanding.</description>

      <description># Target of this article  Purpose of writing the article The words AI and deep learning have been around for a long time, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think there are many people who really understand their meaning. I think it&amp;rsquo;s very dangerous to have a debate about what AI can do, as in Japan today.
I think the reason why there is such a debate about AI in this way is that you do not fully understand the mathematical basis of machine learning.</description>

      <description>When you build a machine learning system that uses Python, you can use data that can be used without restrictions on control mechanisms such as patents called open data that are open to the public on the Internet.  Of course, I use the acquired data to update the model efficiently, but there are times when I want to automate. This time, I will try to use Selenium with the so-called Web scraping.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  We used Airflow as a data pipeline when constructing our data infrastructure. At that time, there were some stumbling blocks, so write them down.
Our Airflow We are developing and operating multiple systems using machine learning. In order to increase the number of projects and the operation, it is necessary to meet the following requirements in common.
 Access multiple required data sources with a single endpoint The same query always returns the same result Queries don&amp;rsquo;t get stuck  Therefore, we decided that the data infrastructure was a necessary phase, and came to build it.</description>

The name of Git/GitHub/GitLab was at a level I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about, but the version control mentioned above is mandatory, and you will be using your own GitLab. Although I was an amateur, I immediately felt the convenience, and I thought that it would be better if I could establish GitLab after studying Docker on ESXi at home.</description>

      <description>## Summary   Various people were writing the code when I searched because I wanted to record Radiko. I could have just run git clone, but I was wondering what kind of processing it was doing, so I tried writing the code myself while reading the code of the predecessors. As I tried it, I learned something, so I summarized it.

AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solution Architect – Associates have a copy of the test book and a practice test, making it an easy environment for studying the test. However, after the developer-associate, there are few Japanese language study books, so if you want to do a mock exam, UdemyandWhizlabs.However,mostofthepracticetestsonthesesitesareinEnglish.(AsofDecember03,2019,thereisoneJapanesemockexaminUdemy)
Difference between Udemy and Whizlabs I thought it would be better to do a lot of mock exams, so I tried English mock exams at Udemy and Whizlabs.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Last time, I analyzed data with Python after a long absence. I forgot how to use pandas.
At that time, I had a sudden thought, &amp;ldquo;Speaking of which, I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of anyone who has used Python in syncing our department.&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;m asking you how many R users are&amp;hellip; (It&amp;rsquo;s natural that it&amp;rsquo;s easy and has many packages.)
I will introduce that Python can also do chemistry.

In this article, I will explain the basics of evaluation methods and model building methods for imbalanced data that are often encountered in actual data analysis. Also, in the second half of the article, we are experimenting to better understand imbalanced data. I think there are many points that cannot be reached, but I would appreciate your favor.</description>

      <description>This article is the 7th day article of [**Maya Advent Calender 2019**](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/Maya).  When you create a tool for modeling in Maya, you may get the vertex position of the selected object. However, in a model with a large number of vertices, acquiring all vertex positions with MEL or cmds will be slow and will hinder modeling work. OpenMaya is often introduced as a method of increasing the processing speed, but for me it was a high threshold and I was wondering if there is a way to increase the processing speed with cmds.</description>

Note: What is ASGI?:briefcase: ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is the spiritual successor to WSGI and aims to provide a standard interface between asynchronous-enabled Python web servers, frameworks, and applications. While WSGI provided the standard for synchronous Python apps, ASGI provides both asynchronous and synchronous apps with a backwards-compatible implementation of WSGI and multiple servers and application frameworks.</description>

Arduino, Raspberry Pi is a rapidly growing ecosystem in the IoT area, but Raspberry Pi can be implemented in Python, but Arduino is much easier to use for a little electronic control. However, there are probably people who want to write in Python, which is familiar to them, rather than the Arduino language (like C/C++). In this article, I would like to write a guide to easily start development using MicroPython, which is embedded Python, in a financial sense.</description>

      <description>This article is posted on [IQ1&#39;s 2nd Advent Calendar 2019](https://adventar.org/calendars/4711).  IQ1 machine learning For machine learning, data preprocessing and model hyper search are inevitable. However, I have an IQ of 1, so I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do it if I can do preprocessing of data and high-para search. If you put the preprocessing of data into this modern gradient boosting tree system algorithm (such as lightgbm), you can handle the missing values as they are and you do not have to preprocess the categorical variables, so it will be a world relatively friendly to IQ1.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the steps that have taken a slightly different step from the general approach to learning machine learning. I would be happy if it could be used as a reference for as many people as possible. I usually write for individual blogs, and I was warmly thinking about writing on my blog, but I thought it was a great opportunity, so I posted it on __qiita for the first time __.</description>

      <description>When you want to do something like machine learning that is popular these days, building an environment with Python is difficult.  The local environment is also dirty&amp;hellip; I often see Anaconda and Miniconda in teaching materials that can learn machine learning while moving the code. And when creating these environments, ROS users often have trouble, but I decided to leave it here because there are surprisingly few articles. The environment is as follows.</description>

      <description>Pokemon Sword Shield has recently been released and is very popular.  So, taking advantage of this popularity of Pokemon, I will explain object-oriented programming using Pokemon.
What is object-oriented programming? &amp;ldquo;Object&amp;rdquo; is a direct translation of an object. In other words, we try to program as we make things.
Things should have features or parts and movements. The kind of thing is called &amp;ldquo;class&amp;rdquo;, each thing is called &amp;ldquo;instance&amp;rdquo;, and the behavior of thing is called &amp;ldquo;method&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  When creating a machine learning dataset based on images collected from the internet, it is necessary to delete duplicate images. It is still good if there are duplicate images in the training data, but if there are duplicate images between the training data and the test data, so-called leakage will occur.
The simplest way to detect duplicate images is to use the hash value of a file such as MD5.</description>

      <description>#Conclusion  Just add swifter method before Pandas apply method
Concrete example import pandas as pd import numpy as np import swifter # Create a suitable DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame({&amp;#39;col&amp;#39;: np.random.normal(size=10000000)}) # Add swifter method before apply method. %time df[&amp;#39;col2&amp;#39;] = df[&amp;#39;col&amp;#39;].swifter.apply(lambda x: x**2) # Wall time: 50 ms # For comparison (normal pandas apply method) %time df[&amp;#39;col2&amp;#39;] = df[&amp;#39;col&amp;#39;].apply(lambda x: x**2) # Wall time: 3.48 s How to install $ pip install -U pandas # upgrade pandas $ pip install swifter In case of ```terminal:conda $ conda update pandas # upgrade pandas $ conda install -c conda-forge swifter</description>

      <description>## 0. Abstract   In many cases, huge earthquakes (M&amp;gt;8) are triggered by the deformation of the earth due to tidal stress caused by the moon. There were also some papers that treated the earthquakes that occurred in the past statistically and discussed the relationship with the tide. However, it goes without saying that even though we discussed the Tidal Phase Angle, we could not find anything that clearly showed Lunar Age or Lunar Phase.</description>

      <description>When implementing a web application using Python in business, we decided to introduce the Clean Architecture to develop while separating the concerns for each layer.  We&amp;rsquo;ve put together a set of practices for developing testable applications, using progressive typing and Dependency Injection to share knowledge with team members.
Clean Architecture This time, since the purpose is a sample using Python, the explanation of Clean Architecture will be simple.

      <description>Recently I had the opportunity to write an orchestration layer (BFF) application in Python.  Although asyncio was introduced from Python 3.4, I/O bound processing can be handled efficiently even with a single thread, but since GIL still exists for CPU bound processing, parallel processing is possible under a single process. It is limited.
From this, it can be seen as a language characteristic that it is more suitable for handling multiple I/O bound processes than CPU bound processes.</description>

      <description>There are several libraries that visualize data in Python, but Pandas alone is quite good.  Visualization using Pandas can be completed in the method chain, which can prevent random scattering of temporary variables. In this article, I will introduce visualization recipes, focusing on the ones I often use in practice.

      <description>This article is the 3rd day of M5 Stack Advent Calendar 2019  Currently, for those who are blind, there are various apps (https://www.tokyo-itcenter.com/700link/sm-iphon4.html#iphone-10-00200).
However, there seems to be no one that can be used, for example, to register (the pattern of) the plastic bottle of tea that you want to drink and recognize it. To check what you have registered, you can use hardware such as Oakham My Eye 2, but the price is hundreds of thousands.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Here is a summary of what I learned about the k-means method. The most basic clustering algorithm.
##reference In understanding the k-means method, I have referred to the following.
 Introduction to machine learning for language processing (natural language processing series)DaiyaTakamura(Author),ManabuOkumura(supervision) Publisher; Corona Essence of machine learningKoichiKato(Author) Publisher; SB Creative Co., Ltd.  #k-means method overview
What is k-means method The k-means method is an algorithm that first divides the data into appropriate clusters, and then adjusts the data so that the data can be divided in a good manner using the average of the clusters.</description>

      <description># Why do you have a lightweight HTTP server?   Scratch 2 offline version can read additional block from JSON format file. The block makes a GET request to an HTTP server outside of Scratch. You can extend the functionality of Scratch by launching a helper app that waits for GET. However, creating a thread for each request that arrives in large numbers from a Scratch loop seems to have a large overhead.</description>

      <description># I tried convolution with sensor data (1 dimensional vector)  The convolutional neural network is generally used in image processing, but this time, I tried using a one-dimensional vector as seen in sensor data. The point is to convert the data structure using reshape to make it pseudo-three-dimensional (RGB, X, Y), which is the same as the image. I think that convolution can extract features even if there are few learning parameters, and is effective in detecting anomalies.</description>

      <description>## Overview  We pursue arbitrary precision diagonalization (dense matrix, sparse matrix) and try various things. I met a library called eigen yesterday and installed it today and used it, so I recorded it as a log.
As an arbitrary precision diagonalization, Mpack implements diagonalization of symmetric and Hermite classes of dense matrices, but since sparse matrices are not provided by lapack in the first place, coarse matrices cannot be solved efficiently.</description>

background When it is extremely difficult to install a specific module, it is very easy to use the already installed AWS AMI or docker container. However, I want to do coding with an IDE such as pycharm, so it is a little difficult to enter the server and develop with vim. .. With pycharm, I logged in to the server with remote, I found a function that can be coded using the interpreter of that server, so I tried it and made a note.</description>

      <description>What is #netmiko  netmiko is a Python library that helps you login and operate network devices with SSH. Currently, it supports Cisco IOS, Juniper JunOS, Palo Alto PAN-OS, etc. Login, configuration mode transition, logout, etc. are abstracted as methods, and each command is a type of library that directly specifies a command. This is less abstract than NAPALM. It can be installed with pip intall netmiko etc.

      <description>The length with the direction can be expressed by a vector. Clifford algebra makes it possible to handle areas and volumes by combining vectors. We introduce a Pauli matrix as a three-dimensional Clifford algebra representation matrix and confirm that it is isomorphic to a biquaternion. The calculation by SymPy is attached.  This is a series article.

      <description>#Introduction  Until now, we have been doing deep learning by running Tensorflow on the back end of Keras. If you just do machine learning in Python, you can use Keras as before, but there are applications where you want to use models and weights learned in Python in C++. Actually, it would be nice to use a model trained with Keras, but it seems easier to code directly with Tensorflow which also has a C++ API, so I will try to attack from there.</description>

      <description>I tried searching for similar sentences with Doc2Vec, so I will introduce the implementation.  What is #Doc2Vec In order for a computer to process natural language, human words must first have a value that the computer can handle. Word2Vec exists as a method to vectorize the meaning of words. For details, the link is very easy to understand, but roughly speaking, it expresses that word in a list of n words before and after.</description>

I made my own deep learning module in Python (on the way). For my own study. The name is Optimizer with no twist. We aim to establish a network with a small number of keystrokes.

Series is used to store one-dimensional data, and Dataframe is used to store two-dimensional data. They are like highly functional one-dimensional arrays and two-dimensional arrays, respectively. High functionality means that each row and column can be named, and many methods are available.</description>

      <description># Problem  When working with Python, I often use the iPython notebook.
The trouble has happened recently. The cell where I wrote the script disappeared as if I had accidentally hit something on the keyboard.
The cause was that I pressed &amp;ldquo;x&amp;rdquo; (lowercase letters). iPython notebook seems to have &amp;ldquo;Edit mode&amp;rdquo; (state with focus in text box) and &amp;ldquo;Command mode&amp;rdquo; (state without focus in text box; press Esc to enter this mode).</description>

      <description>In programming contests, when the answer gets very large, the question often arises is to find too much divided by a prime number.  I studied the way of thinking about such problems, so I will summarize it. The sample code is basically Python 2.7. Reference: Top Coder Trends and Countermeasures 4 (C++: Counting)
What should I do? You just have to ask too much for each calculation.
In case of addition After adding, you can ask for too much.</description>

      <description>## Intro  This is the 9th day article of TensorFlow Advent Calendar 2016.
TensorFlow was released in November 2015, but the &amp;ldquo;namespace&amp;rdquo; function was supported from the beginning. This is used in graph visualization with TensorBoard, but of course it&amp;rsquo;s not the only one. Namespaces are very useful for managing identifiers. I recall C++ when it comes to strong &amp;ldquo;namespace&amp;rdquo; support, but I&amp;rsquo;ll quote it from a C++ instruction book (self-study C++).</description>

 This time I would like to create an original language using PLY(lex+yacc), which is a lexical analyzer/parser library of Python.
Speaking of the original language, TrumpScript, a programming language that imaged Donald Trump, was released before. https://github.com/samshadwell/TrumpScript
TrumpScript has the following features.

The subject is &amp;ldquo;Is there a NaN in the pandas DataFrame?&amp;rdquo; As a simple check that the data is processed properly, I want to check the NaN value in the data frame and where it is. If you want to fill/delete NaN, you can use fillna()/dropna(), but what I want to do now is &amp;ldquo;Check if there is a NaN and display that row (column).</description>

As a general rule, in the algorithm part, in addition to the Python standard library, Only Numpy can be used. Machine learning packages such as scikit-learn and tensorflow are not used. Packages that show results such as matplotlib will be used unless they are related to the implementation of the algorithm.</description>

      <description>Python&#39;s List has functions that change the order, such as sort() and reverse(), but if you use these, you&#39;ll be in trouble if you don&#39;t understand the specifications.  I am addicted to the trouble the other day, so I will leave it.
Return value is None For example, like any other function,
print([1,3,8,7,4].sort()) Even if you write, None is displayed.
In the same way
print([1,3,8,7,4].reverse()) But the result is the same.</description>

      <description>Note that I took a little time to retrieve the closest value from a certain value in the list with Python.  Failure example I saw how to use numpy&amp;rsquo;s searchsorted function on the net, but this function inserts a value into the list Since it is a function that returns the index when doing, it does not necessarily return the index of the value closest to a certain value.</description>

This diagnosis is scored by answering the four-choice question about 50 synonyms/antagonists and tells you where you are in the distribution.
However, it is obvious that this score is not &amp;ldquo;top 0.43%&amp;rdquo; without searching for the corresponding hashtag #my vocabulary on Twitter&amp;hellip;
So I took the score distribution.
~~** In the first place, I do not say that such a diagnosis has no credibility.</description>

The average pairwise stock correlation is the average of the correlation coefficients of price movements between stocks. In general, during the crisis such as the Lehman shock or the European debt crisis, the market as a whole will fall sharply, and then it will rise sharply in reaction, and the correlation coefficient between stocks will increase.</description>

When I looked it up, I could use string.isalnum() to check if it was alphanumeric, so I used it.</description>

What is conditional probability (Bayes&amp;rsquo; theorem)? ? It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of math. Have you heard the term conditional probability? I heard a little about it in the class before, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember much.
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)} = \frac{P(B)P(A|B)}{P(A)} P(B|A) is the probability of event B occurring when event A occurs.</description>

saver = tf.train.Saver() Some processing #Save saver.save(sess, &amp;quot;model.ckpt&amp;quot;) Saving can be done at the end of learning or at a timing in the middle of learning.
read When loading, use the restore method of the saver class you created. You need a session, so load it after creating the session.</description>

      <description>In Python, when creating a function that accepts any number of arguments, prefix it with \* or \*\*.  From the function side, if you add *, it becomes Tuple, and if you add **, you will receive it as a Dictionary. Seen from the caller side, when passing by Tuple, there is no Keyword, when passing by Dictionary, there is Keyword.

      <description>#Introduction  Beforeandprevious using Beginner tutorial translation and actually using TensorFlow I did machine learning. This time I translated the tutorial for Expert.
Deep MNIST for Experts TensorFlow is a powerful library for performing large-scale numerical calculations. One of the best tasks is the training and execution of deep neural networks. In this tutorial we will learn the basic building blocks of a TensorFlow model while building a deep convolutional MNIST classifier.</description>

      <description>First, Python is installed on the Mac from the beginning.  You can use this, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to use the homebrew version.
You can also use pyenv to manage installation and version usage. Here.
###environment
 Mac OSX 10.11.2 (El Capitan)  Standard condition which python /usr/bin/python ###brew version installation
In the brew version, Python 2.x series and Python 3.x series can be installed, and Python 3.x series is installed as Python 3, so they can coexist without any special consideration.</description>

When drawing a graph in Python, I think Matplotlibwillbeused.Recently,Seaborn is a library that cleans graphs, and I love it. However, when you want to select and set colors more freely, it is convenient to customize Colormap with +α. This time I will introduce this.

      <description>Python has a module called itertools. As its name suggests, it is an iterator utility and sometimes it&#39;s a little useful to know.  So make a note of things that you can use appropriately along with personal code examples. Python is 2.7. Since the equivalent writing can be done with the body notation, I tried to summarize only the code that seems to be concise. (There may be something that can be written more concisely.</description>

      <description>[Tips to know when programming competitively in Python2](http://qiita.com/lethe2211/items/b91cc9e2b355ad32f1e6) is divided into data structures.  The Python version is 2.7.5 (In Python3, specifications such as input/output are very different, so I recommend you to refer to other articles).
int Integer type.
Strictly speaking, Python integers have integer type int and long integer type long.
 Type is automatically converted by boundary value like Ruby&amp;rsquo;s Fixnum and Bignum There is no difference in methods that can be used with integer type and long integer type like BigInteger of Java  So don&amp;rsquo;t worry too much about it.</description>

      <description>#Background  Start up multiple processes that take several days on a small server with 4 CPU memory 4G I was running out of memory in a couple of hours if I calculated while maintaining CPU 100% x 4. CPU usage has dropped dramatically. Apparently it was out of memory.
What was happening Increased processing time Nitomonai, process memory usage increased →Memory exhaustion →Memory swap occurs →Memory access speed is significantly degraded → Memory wait CPU usage is less than 1% → It will not end forever (significant deterioration in performance)</description>

      <description>In Python, you may need a counter when turning a for statement in a sequence. :smiley:  At that time, it seems that the easy way is to define the counter outside the for statement and increment it within the for statement, or to acquire the counter using enumerate :relaxed: When I heard the story, I wondered which one could process faster :confused: So I decided to measure the speed :grin: The measurement code is here.</description>

      <description>Generate S3 signed URL using [boto](https://github.com/boto/boto) which is AWS SDK of Python.  Generate only URL If you only want to generate the URL of one item, it is easy to generate it directly from the connection.
conn = boto.connect_s3(aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key) url = conn.generate_url(expire_second, method=&amp;#39;GET&amp;#39;, bucket=&amp;#39;bucket_name&amp;#39;, key=&amp;#39;path/to/file&amp;#39;) #Create a Bucket object and then create it
This is easier if you are looking for items in your bucket.

Target environment  cmake can&amp;rsquo;t get python3 library path and target opencv_python3 becomes unavailable (I think ubuntu 14.04 can&amp;rsquo;t detect python3)  It&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to do in a windows environment, but I never thought that Ubuntu would be such a pain.</description>

&amp;lt;match fizzbuzz&amp;gt; type exec command python /path/to/fizzbuzz.py buffer_path /path/to/buffer_path format tsv keys fizzbuzz flush_interval 5s # for debugging/checking &amp;lt;/match&amp;gt; However, when actually using it, I wanted to specify the Python put in virtualenv, and there was a question that what happened to PYTHONPATH, so I tried specifying command like this.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s true that copy clones of source code are more reliable than code clones, but in many cases the existence of code clones often hurts us at the last minute.  After the person in charge escaped, corrected the source code until late at night, and released it, in fact, I was told that &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m making it with copy and paste, so please test all the other places again&amp;rdquo; and start over Is very, very sad.</description>

Tends to do everything in Python as the language for data analysis Assets by R are attractive and not so easy to truncate.
A common case is where you want to use R for partial data analysis but want to write the entire programming in Python. You may also want to do only plotting in R.</description>

from pprint import pprint class sampleCls(): pass pprint (inspect.getmembers(sampleCls)) When you run
[(&#39;__doc__&#39;, None), (&#39;__module__&#39;,&#39;__main__&#39;)] Like this.
Add one line (instead of pass).

      <description>## The beginning of things  I want to convert the String value &amp;ldquo;false&amp;rdquo; to the Bool value False, is there a good way?
To go a little further, it looks like Boolean.Parse in C# Is there anything? That means.
Conclusion at this stage It seems that distutils.util.strtobool() + bool() described later is dropped.
Previous conclusion 1 This was what I was thinking before that.
def CBool( value ): if isinstance( value, str) and value.</description>

      <description>It seems that almost all of Python&#39;s numerical calculation libraries have been migrated to Python 3 since 2012, so I tried to build the environment with Python 3.  It seems that pyenv is a standard to install and use multiple versions of Python properly. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to use Homebrew on a Mac.
brew install pyenv ↓ Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to write this as .zshrc.
export PYENV_ROOT=&amp;quot;$HOME/.pyenv&amp;quot; export PATH=&amp;quot;$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH&amp;quot; eval &amp;quot;$(pyenv init -)&amp;quot; You can see the list of versions that can be installed with pyenv install.</description>

      <description>Introducing the library &amp;quot;[mojimoji](https://github.com/studio-ousia/mojimoji)&amp;quot; that can convert Japanese character strings into half-width and full-width at high speed with Python.  mojimoji can perform full-width/half-width conversion in Python at high speed. Using the method introduced in here, conversion processing is internally performed using unordered_map of Cython and C++, which is considerably faster than the conventional implementation. Works.
Install % pip install mojimoji Overview mojimoji has two methods, han_to_zen and zen_to_han. You can also take the keyword arguments kana, digit, and ascii respectively to disable the conversion of katakana, numbers, and alphabets.</description>

      <description>You can set default values for arguments in function definitions  def foo(bar=[]): bar.append(&amp;#39;baz&amp;#39;) return bar Executing foo() returns a list called [&#39;baz&#39;]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; foo() [&amp;#39;baz&amp;#39;] What happens if you run the same code again?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; foo() [&amp;#39;baz&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;baz&amp;#39;] The results have changed. The reason for this is that Python&amp;rsquo;s default value for a function is evaluated only once. And the Python list is a mutable object, and the append() destructively adds the argument to the list, so the second execution will return an unexpected result.</description>
