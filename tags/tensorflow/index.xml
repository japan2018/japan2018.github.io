      <description>First article posted as job hunting news.  I tried to read and implement a paper on IIC (Invariant Information Clustering), which is said to be highly accurate and has unsupervised learning. IIC is a method of clustering by maximizing mutual information. IIC paper here
 Invariant Information Clustering for Unsupervised Image Classification and Segmentation Xu Ji, Jo√£o F. Henriques, Andrea Vedaldi
 The framework used is TensorFlow 2.0. The target data is familiar MNIST.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  I am currently a M2 student majoring in CS. I usually write machine learning code in PyTorch. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to write for the time being. PyTorch is said to be &amp;ldquo;Define by Run&amp;rdquo;**, and what is good at the same time when the calculation graph and data are sent is that it is easy to debug because you can check the calculation results on the way. As a PyTorch believer, I need to write code in TensorFlow this time, so I will keep a memo so that I don&amp;rsquo;t forget the know-how at that time.</description>

1. Introduction I remade the MobileNet V2-SSD Lite training environment construction article that I wrote about a year ago into an ultra-simple specification. If you start work from the stage where the latest Docker for GPU is introduced, I think you can start training in about 15 minutes. I think there are almost no mistakes. After learning, I plan to do Integer Quantization of the trained model (.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  I thought about learning AI and making a simple application with the technology I learned, I tried to make something like the following. The reason why I chose Anpanman was because it was a cartoon character that I could easily write. I wanted to handle GAN as a model, and that it is possible to detect abnormalities by learning only normal images I thought I would make it ANOGAN, but when I looked it up, it was called EfficientGAN in the high-speed version of ANOGAN.</description>

      <description># Overview  This is an article about clipping each value held by tensor handled by TensorFlow. Specifically, it is an explanation and implementation example of the tf.clip_by... method.
Why do you do this in the first place? I think there are various uses, but in machine learning related calculations (especially gradient calculation), which is the main purpose of TensorFlow, there are many cases where the sense of scale of the handled variables is different and it can not be calculated well.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Nice to meet you all. This article is just an article that explains mnist_mlp.py line by line. It is for people who are interested in AI but haven&amp;rsquo;t touched it yet. I think that if you read this, you should understand the basic learning flow of deep learning, so I will write. (Originally, it was created in-house with the intention of using it for training)

      <description>## [Content]   ** 2020/02/19 We reviewed some contents and confirmed the operation with Raspberry Pi 3 model B. ** ** Added Node-RED environment construction. **  Finally the Raspberry Pi 4 model B has started selling in Japan. In order to use it immediately, I rewrote the previously posted [Building Raspberry Pi for Python and machine learning study] to the Raspberry Pi 4th edition. In addition to the hardware, I have the latest version of Raspbian (Buster 20200213).</description>

      <description>It is the 11th day of [TensorFlow2.0 Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/tensorflow2).  I would like to summarize the method of preprocessing text using tf.data.Dataset API.
This article will explain in the following order.
 Explain what the tf.data.Dataset API is and how effective it is Explain the actual text preprocessing procedure Summary of tips for improving performance  Since the explanation is long (the code is long&amp;hellip;) If you want to take a bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view by looking at only the code, here.</description>

      <description># Now, the beginning of the mystery solving  Original article: With a deep learning, the recovery rate can exceed 100% in horse racing
First try to move I will purchase the program and try it. As described in the explanation, basically it worked with copy and paste, but the following two places did not work as they are, so I fixed it here.
 Parsing date data Column names of features used for learning and inference  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look exactly the same because it contains random elements, but the graphs also moved in roughly the same way, so it seems to have been reproduced.</description>

      <description># Things to do: point_up:  Read the tensorflow 2.0 tutorial. I would like to investigate and supplement the things I did not understand well in the tutorial to make a memorandum. So you may want to read it along with the tutorial.
#Background I used to use chainer When I was about to learn tensorflow, the mainstream moved to 2.0 before I knew it. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know the tensorflow1 system, but if I do it now, it seems reasonable to start with the 2 system and start reading the tensorflow2 tutorial.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any Japanese article about v0.11.0, so please take a note.
This article is for beginners. Unity beginners mimic one of ML-Agents official tutorials do it It is one of the machine learning, __ which I tried __ Reinforcement Learning.
I will make something like this. :arrow_up:__
For those who know how to operate Unity easily, but who have not done machine learning yet. Rather than focusing on theory, I introduce you to Zakuri so that you can experience while moving your hands.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I was told that &amp;ldquo;AI takes away human work&amp;rdquo; **, but now some people say that &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m in a period of disillusionment&amp;rdquo; **. Thanks to that, I was not robbed of my work, and I am swayed by a crowded train every day. The scams that rob you are also a good thing.
While the development of such AI seems to take a little longer, it is now easy to obtain an environment for learning.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  This is IchiLab from RHEMS Giken.
This time using the Object Detection API of TensorFlow, Let me detect the object I want to recognize, I finally tried it on an Android device.
Many helpful sites have helped me, Still, I had a lot of points that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t solve with just one or two pages.
In this article, I will pick up the parts that I stumbled upon to make a difference, I hope that the number of people who do the same will be reduced.</description>
