      <description>#1. Purpose  If you want to do machine learning, anyone can use scikit-learn etc. to implement it relatively easily. However, in order to achieve results at work or to improve your level, The explanation &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand the background, but I got this result&amp;rdquo; is clearly weak.
In this article, the two aims are to &amp;ldquo;use the scikit-learn first because the theory is good&amp;rdquo; and to &amp;ldquo;understand the background from mathematics&amp;rdquo; from the fourth and later.</description>
