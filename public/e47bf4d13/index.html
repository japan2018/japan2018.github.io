<h1 id="target-of-this-article">Target of this article</h1>
<p>・Person who wants to analyze data in Python in the future, but who wants to know what to do
・For beginners who are considering to engage in work related to artificial intelligence in the future
・Person who wants to become an AI engineer from inexperienced person and wants to know what kind of knowledge is necessary for that
・Those who are thinking about going to an AI programming school or a vocational school but would like to know how to study by themselves</p>
<p>#Not eligible
・Person who has already analyzed data in business
・Those who want to create web applications using deep learning
*Because I don&rsquo;t discuss here how to study technologies such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript, skills necessary for server construction and Web service development, and a series of stories.)
・Deep Learning Qualification Exam Study Method (G test, E qualification, etc.)
It does not cover such items.</p>
<h1 id="minimum-knowledge-required-for-ai-engineer">Minimum knowledge required for AI engineer</h1>
<p>First, I divided the minimum knowledge required for AI engineers into six.
Here, when performing work as an AI engineer in the future, roughly divide it into an overview of the six basic knowledge items.
① Programming skills</p>
<ul>
<li>Python (R, C++, Julia, etc. as needed)</li>
<li>Indispensable libraries for data analysis such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib</li>
<li>Machine learning libraries and frameworks for scikit-learn, TensorFlow, keras (PyTorch, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Data pre-processing is essential for machine learning, but it is a convenient library for data pre-processing.
② Mathematics</p>
<ul>
<li>Differentiation, linear algebra, vectors, matrices, probabilities, etc.
③ Knowledge of statistics</li>
<li>Standard deviation, variance, probability distribution, estimation, test, etc.
④Basic knowledge of machine learning</li>
<li>Supervised and unsupervised learning</li>
<li>Preprocessing, feature design, learning and evaluation</li>
<li>Simple regression, multiple regression analysis, lasso, ridge, least squares, perceptron, logistic regression</li>
<li>Decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, K-means, ensemble learning</li>
<li>Deep learning implementation skills and knowledge</li>
<li>scikit-learn and XGBoost</li>
<li>Knowledge of frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras</li>
<li>Flow of making a model already trained with scikit-learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>(1. Data collection and data pre-processing Completion of missing values and removal of outliers)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Design of features (selection of features)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model development (model selection and learning)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model evaluation: Cross-validation, mixed matrix evaluation, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>⑤ Knowledge of operating database using SQL</p>
<ul>
<li>select, insert, update, delete, where, like, limit, sum, avg, max, group by, having, order by, table join, view, subquery, case etc.
⓺ Cloud knowledge</li>
<li>Knowledge of cloud infrastructure such as AWS, GCP and Azure
You might think that there are 6 big ones, and it seems that there are a lot of them, but we recommend that you first focus on two, ① and ④, instead of doing all at once.
The reason is that actually writing the program and making it visible makes it easier to continue learning.
If you start from theory, you will be frustrated if you are self-taught.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="recommended-way-to-study-artificial-intelligence-by-yourself">Recommended way to study artificial intelligence by yourself</h1>
<p>The knowledge you need was introduced in the previous section, but how can you learn them?
To learn ① to ⑥, we recommend that you acquire the knowledge in the following order.
Phase 1 Learning Machine Learning Programming and Artificial Intelligence with python
Phase 2 Machine Learning Programming
Challenge Phase 3 Kaggle
Phase 4 Students will also acquire technology such as SQL, scraping, and cloud.
Phase 5 teach
I think that learning in each of these phases will be the most enjoyable and least burdensome for you.
In Phase 1, we refer to those who are new to programming.
If you are new to programming, please read through Phase 1.
In Phase 2, we will explain the learning methods related to machine learning programming based on what we actually learned in Phase 1.
If you are already doing machine learning programming using scikit-learn, you can skip it.
Phase 3 describes how to learn practical programming through competitions such as Kaggle.
Phase 4 In doing machine learning, data is often retrieved from the database, so knowledge of SQL is essential. Here, we will introduce how to acquire techniques such as scraping (for data collection) and cloud in addition to SQL.
Phase 5 Teaching someone can clarify what you didn&rsquo;t know. Therefore, it is good to teach machine learning to friends etc. to deepen their understanding.</p>
<p>From now on, I will explain how to deal with each of the five phases by introducing recommended books and so on.</p>
<h3 id="phase-1-learn-machine-learning-programming-with-python-and-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence">Phase 1 Learn Machine Learning Programming with Python and Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>Self-study, using books,
The minimum knowledge required to develop artificial intelligence is &ldquo;knowledge of machine learning&rdquo;, &ldquo;knowledge of Python&rdquo;, and &ldquo;mathematics and probability/statistics for machine learning&rdquo;.
In this phase, you can focus on &ldquo;Knowledge of machine learning&rdquo; and &ldquo;Knowledge of Python&rdquo;, and temporarily turn &ldquo;Mathematics and probability/statistics for machine learning&rdquo; to different phases.
Even if you don&rsquo;t know mathematics or probability, you can experience machine learning by using a library for machine learning, and it is more motivated and less expensive than learning only theory. (I don&rsquo;t affirm that some people can continue from the theory.)
After that, after implementing the implementation that relies on the library, I recommend you to go back once and learn mathematics/statistics, etc. once you are wondering what is going on inside.
Then, I will introduce __ recommended books. __
First of all, if you are new to programming or are not confident in the basic syntax of Python, the following books are recommended.
・Introduction to Python3
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/171715/6b05e2ee-d7c4-4516-96ef-a3e23584beac.jpeg" alt="p.jpg">
<a href="http://amzn.asia/8ccnGQH">http://amzn.asia/8ccnGQH</a>
2894 jpy
This book not only teaches the basic grammar that is the basis of python, but also the basics of machine learning programming.
By reading through this book, you can experience the basic power of python programming and machine learning programming.
Also, when you start python programming, you don&rsquo;t need a development environment and you can use it for free with a CPU/GPU machine learning environment <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/Let'sdoPythonprogrammingusingnotebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true">Google Colaboratory</a>__.
Next, if you would like to learn more about the overview of artificial intelligence, I recommend the following books.
・Artificial intelligence is beyond human beings or beyond deep learning (Kadokawa EPUB selection) [Book]
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/171715/191649fe-bb3c-cc7a-96a8-0ffcb06bb875.png" alt="ai.png">
<a href="http://amzn.asia/iW1Ms5S">http://amzn.asia/iW1Ms5S</a>

For the above two books, read the Python book, and proceed while moving the programs that appear.
By the way, if you know the knowledge about artificial intelligence and the basics of Python programming in the above two books,
Let&rsquo;s start programming a series of machine learning and statistical machine learning.</p>
<h3 id="phase-2-machine-learning-programming">Phase 2 Machine Learning Programming</h3>

Please use the following video as well.
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/python-scikit-learn/">Machine learning with Python: An introduction to identification with scikit-learn</a></p>
<h3 id="challenge-phase-3-kaggle">Challenge Phase 3 Kaggle</h3>
<p>By the way, in Phases 1 and 2, I introduced the books related to machine learning sold at bookstores.
If you move through the above books in sequence for 1 to 3 months, you should be at a level where you can read and write the machine learning model flow and the machine learning model yourself.
Here, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>and<a href="https://signate.jp/">SIGNATE(formerDeepAnalytics)</a> will be used as the next phase.
Kaggle is a competition site for data scientists from all over the world.
The data that companies want to analyze is put here, and users analyze it and compete for the accuracy of analysis.
The top three companies will also receive prize money from the companies that gave the data.
The recommended use of Kaggle is to use a feature called Kernels.
In the kernel, for each data set, there is an easy-to-understand explanation of the code of the model built by other users.
As you can see when you actually do data analysis with __Kaggle, preprocessing the data is very important. __
__ The key here is to be able to use pandas well. __
If you have any questions about pandas data processing,
Please revisit from <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html">pandas official tutorial</a>.
As a book, <a href="http://amzn.asia/1Al0GEt">Introduction to data analysis using Python</a> is recommended.</p>
<h3 id="phase-4-also-acquire-technologies-such-as-sql-scraping-and-cloud">Phase 4 Also acquire technologies such as SQL, scraping, and cloud.</h3>
<p>Regarding actual data, if it is data on the Web, it is often stored in a database, so knowledge of SQL is also required.
Here, I will introduce the books that can be used as a reference for data analysis using SQL.
・Progate SQL Edition (for beginners in SQL)
<a href="https://prog-8.com/languages/sql">Progate SQL</a></p>

Data collection may be done from the database or scraping.
Scraping is a technology for collecting information posted on websites.
Here are two recommended books for learning scraping skills.

·Cloud
Here is a brief description of Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Google Cloud Platform is a generic term for cloud services that can be used by paying only for the huge amount of services owned by Google, such as machine learning and machine learning, and in developing services by using GCP You can use high-performance data analysis and machine learning services around the infrastructure through various APIs.
As services that are often compared with GCP, there are AWS of Amazon, Azure of Micro soft, etc., but please see the following articles for the differences between them.
<a href="https://clonos.jp/knowledge/detail01/">Differences between Google Cloud Platform, AWS, and Azure</a>
You can also call the GCP API with Python, but as shown in the image below, APIs such as image recognition/video analysis, voice recognition, and natural language processing are available.When you make something you want to make, you can use API to make something more accurate and easier than making it yourself from scratch using scikit-learn or Keras.
You can implement it if you look for the API that suits you, search the documentation, search Google, or search qiita for the article that came out. __

<h3 id="phase-5-teaching">Phase 5 Teaching</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve learned programming or machine learning, I recommend teaching it to someone because it can be a friend.
As a way to teach, it is good to hold an event or seminar, use Skype etc. to give one-on-one lessons to friends, or teach directly at a cafe.
Besides teaching, I think it would be good to write articles on Qiita or blogs, or write books.
AI Academy also holds exchange meetings for students and LT meetings, and we also offer opportunities to teach in public, so please take advantage of it!</p>

<p>![Screenshot 2020-03-13 16.56.02.png](<a href="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/195675/f21dc662-c149-7a6e-8eab-(8cd2e67cd2e6.png)">https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/195675/f21dc662-c149-7a6e-8eab-(8cd2e67cd2e6.png)</a></p>
<p>Please read from the left book (STEP1) to the right book (STEP3) in order.
If you already know the basics of python programming, you can skip STEP1, and if you already know the basics of machine learning programming and math of machine learning with scikit-learn, you can skip STEP2.
Start from the STEP that suits your current level.
If you are new to __python programming, or what is artificial intelligence? If you are interested, please start from STEP 1. __
As I&rsquo;ve written many times, the point is that the code that appears in the book is basically written and proceeded.
For example, when studying English, writing, reading or listening is more effective than just looking at the teaching materials.
The programming language is the same, and understanding is deepened by actually transcribing rather than just looking at the book.
However, it is not necessary to understand 100% of all teaching materials.
It is a criterion for deciding when to proceed to the next step, but a level of _____ is sufficient if you can understand 70% without understanding everything that is written in the book.
Once you get there, move on to the next.
For details, please refer to the above <strong>Recommended method for studying artificial intelligence by yourself</strong>.
For those who can start from STEP 1, I would like to be able to analyze ○○ data! If so, you can skip the deep learning part with neural networks and Keras.
Once, STEP1 → STEP2 → Challenge Phase 3 Kaggle → After that, I hope you can proceed to neural network implementation &amp; deep learning library (TensorFlow, keras, etc.) as necessary.
Because you can also use neural network for scikit-learn, if you have not decided to use deep learning in your work, or if you are aiming for data analysis, you do not need to learn deep learning firmly. That&rsquo;s the reason.
However, if you want to find a job or change jobs as an AI engineer, make sure you understand the contents of &ldquo;Deep Learning from scratch&rdquo;.</p>
<p>#For those who want to acquire skills in specialized fields</p>
<p>If you have read all the above books, there are some books (good books) that you should read in order to become an AI engineer (machine learning engineer), so I will also introduce them.
<em>Although it&rsquo;s just artificial intelligence, there are several things such as image recognition, natural language processing, voice recognition, and generation.
Here are some recommended books to help you acquire the skills of those specialized fields.

#For those who are seriously aiming to be an AI engineer
By learning the above contents in order, you will acquire certain basic skills and be able to enter the entrance as an AI engineer.
However, there is a possibility that there is still a lack of knowledge to be active as an AI engineer in practice.
In that case, we recommend that you also read the following study methods and books.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make it possible to write machine learning algorithms in C++ and Java languages.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.asia/5118g0M">&ldquo;Introduction to Statistical Modeling for Data Analysis-Generalized Linear Model/Hierarchical Bayes Model/MCMC&rdquo;</a>
And <a href="http://amzn.asia/6RuVPNl">Introduction to Statistics (Basic Statistics I)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.asia/8mAkkJN">Basics of statistical learning-data mining/inference/prediction</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you for reading.
We have an online AI programming called AI Academy
We operate a learning service and provide support to those who want to learn AI in the shortest time.
The following three points are provided as the main service.</p>
<ul>
<li>Text content that extracts only the necessary parts from the books featured this time (You can browse from your smartphone or PC.)
・Respond to questions in chat and code review (__ *You can ask questions other than AI Academy content.__)
・Learning progress service (suggestion of the shortest route to the product you want to make, what to do next)
I&rsquo;ve written it for a long time, but to learn all the above books from one, there is a reasonable learning cost (at least about 6 months).
If you can use a short-term boot camp (online and offline 2-axis school) like ours, we can greatly reduce the learning cost, so please consider once.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to know more about <a href="https://aiacademy.jp/bootcamp/">AI Academy Bootcamp</a>, please send an email to <a href="mailto:aiacademy@cyberbra.in">aiacademy@cyberbra.in</a>.</p>
