#Introduction
This article has been a hot topic recently! [Python] I visualized Arashi&amp;rsquo;s lyrics in WordCloud and tried to figure out what I wanted to tell the fans in 20 years since formation
It makes me really happy when my favorite idols and artists are active and loved for many years.</description>

      <description># at first   I created it because I wanted to make WordCloud. Code may be wrong (sorry)  #Environment
 Python 3.7.3 Jupyter Notebook Windows  #Flow 1. Extracting text with scraping 2. Divide words using MeCab 3. WordCloud creation
#1.Scraping Here has &amp;ldquo;Galaxy Railway Night&amp;rdquo; on the site, so extract only the text from here.
 &amp;lt;div class = &amp;#34;main-text&amp;#34;&amp;gt; As you can see, if you extract the text of the lower level of this&amp;rsquo;div&amp;rsquo;, it will be ok!</description>

      <description>#Trigger  It&amp;rsquo;s only one year left until Arashi&amp;rsquo;s activities stop. It&amp;rsquo;s been 20 years since the appearance of invisibility costumes. What did the national idol, who is active in multiplayer, want to tell the fans 20 years after the formation? I would like to meet you in person, but that&amp;rsquo;s why. So I decided to &amp;ldquo;visualize the lyrics&amp;rdquo; and convey the message I want to convey to the fans, ~~ the 6th member~~ to Arashi fans.</description>
