      <description>#1. About this article  ##1-1. Introduction This article was touched by me as a high school student when I received [Udemy: An Introduction to Blockchain Development from Scratch Beginning with Python Taught by Active Silicon Valley Engineers](https://www.udemy.com/share/1021OSAkIbdVdQQXo=/) , I wrote this article with the hope that everyone reading this article should attend. I completed this lesson in 2 days, so if you are already accustomed to development, I think it is sufficiently possible to understand and implement in 1 day.</description>

      <description>#Beware of data scientists  As of 2019, there should be a lot of people out there who want to be distracted by data scientists. However, those who don&amp;rsquo;t know how to be more pretentious than others. I completely removed the muddy data scientist aspect and wondered how I could be distracted. You can put your conclusion into practice immediately tomorrow. If you want to be a data scientist, give it a try.</description>

      <description># Overview  This article is a step-by-step article on how a beginner himself developed a coupon distribution service for iPhone with RESTful API and swift. It was a very detouring implementation because we implemented it while examining the technical elements one by one.
