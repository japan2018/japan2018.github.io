      <description>The thing about this is that the engineer who is a civil engineering major is nasal dripping and that it is a hard-working crystal.  The finger picking is very clean and really white, and it is also very nice and thrown.
The beginning of things I said, &amp;ldquo;No, but I&amp;rsquo;ll write Pyhton for a long time, and I&amp;rsquo;ll understand Python completely!&amp;rdquo;
I will see it in docs.python.org for the first time in a while.</description>

      <description>#1.First of all  Recently, there were the following hurdles regarding programming.
(1) I want to create a GUI program in Python. → You can use Tkinter (2) I want to display some calculation results on a graph. → You can use matplotlib (3) I want to embed the graph written in matplotlib in (2) into Tkinter in (1). → NG
I tried to get over it by tampering with the example code, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <description>Pokemon Sword Shield has recently been released and is very popular.  So, taking advantage of this popularity of Pokemon, I will explain object-oriented programming using Pokemon.
What is object-oriented programming? &amp;ldquo;Object&amp;rdquo; is a direct translation of an object. In other words, we try to program as we make things.
Things should have features or parts and movements. The kind of thing is called &amp;ldquo;class&amp;rdquo;, each thing is called &amp;ldquo;instance&amp;rdquo;, and the behavior of thing is called &amp;ldquo;method&amp;rdquo;.</description>
