<pre><code>Hello.
</code></pre>
<p>watawatavoltage. In this article, I would like to write about the world of control engineering books.
This article is a type of article that is updated as needed, rather than being posted in the completed state.
&ldquo;Introduction&rdquo; explains why we write such articles.
If you write a book that you would like to introduce in the comment section, it will be reflected at any time. Thank you.</p>
<p>#Introduction
Wouldn&rsquo;t everyone have this kind of experience?</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know this control book! !</li>
<li>Why this formula is like this! !</li>
<li>The professor said &ldquo;Search for control&rdquo;, but where can I write it? !</li>
<li>Where was that formula written? ?</li>
<li>Is there a recommended book for wheel seminars? ?</li>
<li>I want to understand from the program~</li>
<li>Can I buy this book~</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that there is no end to this (bullets are added at any time. We also accept comments).</p>
<p>I have always experienced the above.</p>
<p>Therefore, the following wishes are born.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have any questions, how many pages of this textbook should you look at immediately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think there are things like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s important to investigate&rdquo;, &ldquo;the idea that if you don&rsquo;t have that ability,&rdquo; &ldquo;the teacher actually has that ability,&rdquo; and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t buy a book yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, it is difficult because it is rejected. Rather, I think it is necessary to write a map (the world of control engineering books) in which many textbooks of control engineering are written for each field and what is not written is classified and arranged accurately.</p>
<p>From my experience, I think that many people in the area of control engineering are quite smart.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that there is an opinion that such a map is not necessary, but I think it is also important to lower the threshold for those who are new to control and casual people.</p>
<p>First of all, I will prepare a map around classical control and modern control.</p>
<p>#World of books related to &ldquo;classical control/modern control&rdquo;
First of all, I would like to start with this book, which has become a hot topic these days.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-control-engineering-using-pythonhttpswwwohmshacojpbook9784274223907"><a href="https://www.ohmsha.co.jp/book/9784274223907/">Introduction to control engineering using Python</a></h2>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/328296/7ea5005c-c144-6f54-41f5-514a0de5102a.jpeg" alt="978-4-274-22390-7.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Book Contents</strong></p>
<p>It is written comprehensively from the classical control to the basics of modern control. Recommended for beginners in control. It also handles advanced controls such as robust control and digital control. Until now, many control textbooks have been able to be learned along with the MATLAB source code. On the other hand, in this book, as the title suggests, you can learn control engineering with Python, which is one of the programming languages. Also, we explain the control while weaving together cute girl characters. Books on such control engineering have never existed before, so they are fresh.</p>
<p><strong>Watawata voltage impressions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Python is one of the many artificial programming languages used in the field of machine learning. Even people who are always using machine learning can immediately use control engineering. Since Python is free to use, you can immediately try control engineering samples without purchasing paid software such as MATLAB.</li>
<li>I have never seen an explanation of control engineering using a girl character, Moe Moe. This is a device to lower the hurdles of control engineering.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the content of control engineering is thinner than other books as a result of using a lot of explanations of Moe characters and visual bases (I omit many parts). However, since the points are explained well, it is enough to understand control engineering. Also, <a href="https://y373.sakura.ne.jp/minami/pyctrl">Minami-sensei&rsquo;s site</a>specifiestheomittedpartsandguidesyoutolearninotherbooksimmediately.Youcanlearnthevideoofcontrolengineeringfrom<a href="https://note.com/y373">Prof.MinamihimselfcontrolsystemYoutuber</a>.</li>
<li>Watawatavoltage thinks that the possibilities of Python x Moe character x control engineering are endless. It is one of the turning points in the control industry, and if this trend is put to good use, it will be a great opportunity to spread control engineering to young people all over Japan. watawatavoltage also wants to actively participate in this trend.</li>

<p><strong>Book Contents</strong></p>
<p>This book is the classic control bible. It is recommended for those who are new to control research, those who study control, and those who use PID control in companies. We explain what control is and explain the importance of feedback control. In addition, it is easy to get an idea of what control engineering can be applied to, including mathematical expressions for various dynamical systems. There are also more advanced controls such as robust control and two-degree-of-freedom control, which are very helpful books. It also covers the gain tuning method used for PID control.</p>
<p><strong>Watawata voltage impressions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I think feedback control is famous when it comes to control, but this book should explain why feedback control is necessary and why feedforward control is not enough. I felt that I was very close to a control beginner.</li>
<li>The transfer function, which is the basis of the control, is described in detail, including how to write block diagrams and equivalent transformations.</li>
<li>Robust stability should be explained using examples.</li>
<li>Rather than hitting a poor control engineering site or book, referring to this book often solves the problem immediately.</li>
<li>One of the authors <a href="http://www.fl.ctrl.titech.ac.jp/text_old/Feedback/">Professor Fujita&rsquo;s site</a> has a summary of each chapter of this book and a careful explanation of exercises. ing. If you combine these, you can boost your study speed.</li>

This book focuses on classical control. This is a book completed by the author, Professor Kawata, who has compiled the materials he created when he conducted his own lectures and student experiments. Every chapter contains a set of exercises by control theory and MATLAB/SIMULINK. In other words, you can first learn the theory of control through classroom learning (paper and pencil), and then actually experience the control through programming exercises. In particular, in Chapter 5, the PID control is explained using the vertical drive arm as an example, so you can learn the theory and practical application of control engineering at the same time. Also, Chapter 8 includes a little explanation of modern control.</p>
<p><strong>Watawata voltage impressions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I think that it is a pioneer of books that can learn both theory and programs that have come to be seen frequently in recent years (please let us know in the comments if they are different).</li>
<li>Since the control theory part and the programming part are written separately, I think it is easy to study each part.</li>
<li>Also, since he gave a lecture on how to use SIMULINK from the basics, I think it is nice for users who use control with SIMULINK.</li>
<li>The modern control in Chapter 8 has a small number of pages, but it is well covered from state space representation to servo system design using optimal regulators.</li>
<li>It is good that the appendix covers the basic usage of MATLAB and the description of graph output (I have been wondering how to draw a graph).</li>
<li>Recommended for beginners.</li>

<p><strong>Book Contents</strong>
This book was written by Professor Kawata. This book is a sequel to the easy-to-understand control engineering using MATLAB/SIMULINK explained above. Chapter 8 of the book had an explanation of modern control, but since it was only for one chapter, it was only a brief explanation of the effects of modern control. This book describes eight chapters from the state space representation of the system to the control using the optimal regulator. In addition, learning that combines control theory and programming exercises with MATLAB is in good health, and the same flow as in the previous book can be studied. In addition, Chapter 9 describes control system design using linear matrix inquality (LMI).</p>
<p><strong>Watawata voltage impressions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since the programming part is colored, it is easier to see than the previous book.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t think there are so many books to learn modern programming by programming with MATLAB, so I think it will be very useful (maybe only I don&rsquo;t know).</li>
<li>Chapter 9 describes the control system design using LMI. It may be a device to explain advanced control in the final chapter to make students interested in control (total speculation).</li>
<li>In addition to the above speculation, since the authors are the same, in fact there are three parts: &ldquo;Easy-to-understand control engineering with MATLAB/SIMULINK → Introduction to modern control with MATLAB/SIMULIK → Control engineering with inverted pendulum&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m very impressed that these books are gathered at my hand.</li>

<p><strong>Book Contents</strong>
This book is a textbook focusing on modern control. First, the history of control is introduced, and then the mathematical model of the system is explained.
After suppressing the basics of mathematics, the contents of modern control theory are explained. Compared to other books, the meaning of mathematical expressions and the expansion of expressions are carefully explained, which is very helpful. In addition, the beginning of the chapter is characterized by the quotes of great people who were active in the science field and great people in the control field. In addition, when a person&rsquo;s name appears in the text, a portrait of that person is posted, so &ldquo;I wonder if this person thinks.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a great book for me.</p>
<p><strong>Watawata voltage impressions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I like technical books that have lots of supplementary explanations and feature great people.</li>
<li>Calculations are written properly.</li>
<li>The meaning and positioning of expressions are written properly. On the other hand, it seems difficult to explain this book, so it might be good to study it in combination with other books.</li>

<p><strong>Book Contents</strong>
This book is mainly written in modern control. It is also characterized by the inclusion of a chapter explaining robust control. The Control Engineering textbook, recommended for those who want to learn exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Watawata voltage impressions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a recommended book for those who seek mathematical rigor because the explanation is accurate.</li>
<li>In the chapter that describes robust control, the explanation of the significance of robust control and model error is simplified, so it is better to read another book on that point.</li>
<li>Beginners of control should refer to another softly written book.</li>

<p><strong>Book Contents</strong>
This book is a book where you can learn modern control theory through exercises. So there are few proofs of mathematical formulas. There is no classical control. In the controller design part, you can learn pole placement by the Ackermann method and the method of Arimoto and Potter through exercises.</p>
<p><strong>Watawata voltage impressions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compared to other books, basic exercises are tightly packed. It is useful in that sense because it is important to learn theory (from concrete content to abstract content) through exercises.</li>
<li>Compared to other control engineering books, this book is much thinner, so I think you can feel free to collaborate.</li>
<li>Some places will have a review of linear algebra, so you can learn both control engineering and linear algebra.</li>
<li>It is interesting that you can learn various design methods in modern control through exercises. In other books, there are many patterns that are introduced a little or not in the first place, but this book is different. Also, it is good that the comparison of these design methods is adopted as an exercise problem. It is also recommended for active learning.</li>

<p><strong>Book Contents</strong>
This book is a book where you can practically learn robust control as the title says. First, I will briefly explain the positioning of robust control. In the field of control, you will first learn classical control. In classical control, the controller is decided by trial and error based on the frequency response of the system such as Bode plot or Nyquist plot. Since it is difficult to deal with classical control when the order of the controlled object becomes large or it becomes a multi-input/output system, modern control theory solves these problems. However, modern control theory requires an accurate model of the controlled object. A model error exists between the actual controlled object and the model, and the controller designed based on the model adversely affects the control result. The controlled object may become unstable. In robust control, the controlled object is expressed as a nominal model (rough model) + model error, and a controller is designed for those systems. Therefore, it can be stabilized even if there is a model error. This book describes the concept of robust control, the method of expressing the controlled object with model error, and the robust stabilization problem. After that, learn the actual design procedure through programming using MATLAB with actual application examples. It also describes the limits of robust control and the implementation of a controller (digital controller) in an actual machine.</p>
<p><strong>Watawata voltage impressions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I think most of the robust control can be learned with this book.</li>
<li>If you just want to try it out, programming the controller in Chapter 4 with MATLAB is sufficient. You can practice that robust control is powerful in Chapter 4 alone.</li>
<li>The theory and practice parts of robust control (programming with MATLAB) are arranged in a well-balanced manner, which is exactly &ldquo;practical robust control&rdquo;.</li>
<li>It is good to have an example of hard disk drive control. I think watawata voltage is an example in which the robust control scenario is well understood.</li>
<li>Because the program of MATLAB is loaded, it is easy for beginners to learn. In addition, the sample code can be downloaded from the home page of this manual.</li>
<li>I think there is more, but I will write it when I come up with it.</li>

<p><strong>Book Contents</strong>
This book mainly describes modern control theory. Then why is it not in the world of modern control theory books? This is because advanced controls such as optimal control and robust stability are on board. Other books dealing with modern control theory do not cover such topics (not all have been confirmed). It is characteristic that the theorem proof is written carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Watawata voltage impressions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is interesting to read the Note part of the author. It can be surprising.</li>
<li>The talk of optimal control and robust stability is quite enthusiastic, and I would like to call it a summary of titles.</li>
<li>This book is B5 size, so it is bigger than other books. It means that the content is so substantial.</li>
<li>I want to read the optimal control part firmly.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m very impressed because I&rsquo;ve never seen a book in which robust control and optimal control live together.</li>

<p>#The world of books related to &ldquo;learning from actual applications&rdquo;
In this section, I would like to introduce a book that features practical applications and from which you can learn control engineering.</p>
<h2 id="control-engineering-learned-with-inverted-pendulumhttpswwwmorikitacojpbooksbook3110"><a href="https://www.morikita.co.jp/books/book/3110">Control engineering learned with inverted pendulum</a></h2>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/328296/a90daa59-6b53-562f-6a43-9ffd9052982a.jpeg" alt="079221cvr.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Book Contents</strong>As the title says, you can study control engineering using an actual application example of an inverted pendulum. Of the many examples of actual applications, the reason why we paid attention to the inverted pendulum, which I have touched upon in this book, is that it is an unstable system and that the effectiveness of feedback control can be confirmed. Also, you can easily create a real machine. Also, the inverted pendulum is excellent as a subject for applying classical control and modern control. In the contents of this manual, first, the mechanical parts, sensors, amplifiers, etc. necessary for constructing the inverted pendulum are introduced, and you can see what the configuration is. From there, the explanation is about control. In the control part, you can learn PID control, modern control, modeling, and parameter identification in the basic section. You can also learn about the discretization required when implementing the designed control law on a computer. In the advanced section, from advanced control system design using Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) to sample value control to control a continuous-time system with a discretized controller, and finally stabilization from the swing-up of an inverted pendulum. You can learn non-linear control that enables computerized control.</p>
<p><strong>Watawata voltage impressions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This book is recommended for people who want to control an inverted pendulum. If you have an inverted pendulum from the beginning to the end and want to move the inverted pendulum anyway, you can buy this book without any problems.</li>
<li>You can learn the whole procedure of designing a control system because it describes everything from modeling of an inverted pendulum (including linear approximation) to parameter identification and control.</li>
<li>It is very valuable to learn advanced controls such as linear matrix inequality, sampled value control, and non-linear control in this book. The point that the explanation is easy to understand is also wonderful. No book will introduce the above three controls at the same time (maybe there).</li>
<li>I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the basics of linear matrix inequalities. Books dealing with control of linear matrix inequalities from 1 to 10 (for example, <a href="https://www.morikita.co.jp/books/book/2402">System control by LMI</a>)and[Controlsystemdesignbymatrixinequalityapproach]](<a href="https://www.coronasha.co.jp/np/isbn/9784339033236/">https://www.coronasha.co.jp/np/isbn/9784339033236/</a>)) is available, but this book is good for the time being if you use it lightly.</li>
<li>The contents of modern control are abundant and well explained, but regarding classical control, PID control was suddenly explained because feedback control, block diagram and control system analysis were not explained. It comes from the explanation of. If you have any questions about classical control, we recommend that you learn the basics from the introduction to feedback control given above and then learn the classical control part of this book.</li>
<li>MATLAB/SIMULINK program has been uploaded to <a href="http://www.maizuru-ct.ac.jp/control/kawata/study/book_ip/files2.html">Support page of this document</a>,andlinearmatrixSoftwarenecessaryforusingtheinequalitycanbedownloadedfrom<a href="http://www.maizuru-ct.ac.jp/control/kawata/study/book_ip/files1.html">thissupportpage</a>. It&rsquo;s great that the support is good.</li>
<li>Also, the basis of this book is an explanation article of the journal of the Society of Systems Control Information. So, I think it is fun to try those articles.</li>
<li>I feel that there are few sites that explain linear matrix inequalities, so I will post an article on qiita again.</li>

<p><strong>Book Contents</strong>
This book focuses on classical control. Also, the reason why classification is not a classical control but a real application example is that we always use a real application example to explain control. So, there are few mathematical expressions, and instead, the control is explained by sentences, figures and tables. Recommended for reading.</p>
<p><strong>Watawata voltage impressions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is wonderful that you carefully explain the control system design procedure using tables and figures. In other books, there are many places where the text is easily read.</li>
<li>The variety of practical application examples described in the introduction is plentiful and interesting.</li>
<li>It is easy to get an image, because it is explained in every unit in relation to practical application examples.</li>
<li>Since the number of mathematical formulas is quite small, the theory part must be covered by other books.</li>
