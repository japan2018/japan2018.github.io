<pre><code>About 3 years ago [The result of my own development of a machine learning stock price forecast program at WEB shop \| Masamnet](http://masamunet.com/2016/11/09/web%E5%B1%8B%E3%81%AE%E8%87%AA%E5%88%86%E3%81%8C%E6%A9%9F%E6%A2%B0%E5%AD%A6%E7%BF%92%E6%A0%AA%E4%BE%A1%E4%BA%88%E6%83%B3%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E3%82%92%E9%96%8B%E7%99%BA/) I wrote an article, and I did not do much with machine learning or stocks, but at the beginning of this year's end of the year, I dared to I tried various things.
</code></pre>
<p>So, I got a pretty good result, so I will write the technical background until it started as a service as it is.
The link to the service itself is a paid service, so I think that there are people who can not see it because of religious reasons, so I will not put it here. From a personal point of view, I think it is important for technicians to create a system that allows them to earn money appropriately. This is not the place to discuss such a thing, so I will refrain from linking the service itself. However, I think that there is an opinion that it can not be judged unless you look at the actual service, so I would like to put a link at the end of the article that will lead you to the service if you follow it lightly. .. This is the introduction, and I will introduce what the final structure was.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/3707/28603c4c-dcd1-0d2a-3c10-60cc31d6e72d.png" alt="resemble_stock_whole.png"></p>
<p>In a word, what I want to say about the article is that Docker was compatible with me when I tried to make it a web service so that it could be widely used because the result of machine learning was good, so I would like to introduce it.</p>
<p>We use a variety of technologies across the board, but all of them use only the basics, so I don&rsquo;t think a detailed explanation is necessary. However, I am worried about proceeding with a &ldquo;I know&rdquo; body, so I will just talk about each technology.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>
-Virtual container technology. You can enjoy the benefits of virtual machines that virtually confine machines by using file I/O and the convenience of stacking environments like containers.</li>
<li><strong>Python</strong>
-Somehow machine learning is like Python. Rather than a programmer who delivers the source code itself, it tends to be more useful to those who derive some answer based on the data calculated using the program. However, the Python name has spread to people who are not familiar with programming anymore, and in the future, some people will say Python, etc. Python has no sin.
-<strong>Flask</strong>
-Very convenient when you want to publish a program made in Python to the outside.</li>
<li><strong>sqlite</strong>
-I just want to execute a simple SQL statement, but I have a hard time using CSV, but it is not as good as using RDBMS, but rather useful when I do not want to use it. As I will explain later, the data is highly portable, so I personally think it&rsquo;s perfect for scraping.</li>
<li><strong>NuxtJS</strong>
-As the word &ldquo;mochi is a mochiya&rdquo; suggests, the front end uses various frameworks for the front end, if possible.</li>
<li><strong>Express.js</strong>
-As the word &ldquo;mochi is mochiya&rdquo; means, the backend that interacts directly with the front end uses various frameworks to make various progress. The leads you want to provide to the user and the leads that the system is convenient for are not necessarily the same, so the key to designing an API that directly interacts with the front end is how to absorb such a problem. NuxtJS alone can perform backend processing during server-side rendering, but from my personal experience, if NodeJS can be used on the server side, that is, if you try to run NuxtJS in an environment that allows server-side rendering, it is easy. Even for backend processing, you should consider introducing Express.js from the beginning without trying to cover it with NuxtJS.</li>
<li><strong>AmazonPay</strong>
-A payment service for small charges that Amazon is doing. I&rsquo;m using it for the first time this time, and I&rsquo;m trying various things whether it&rsquo;s good or bad. I was confused with paypal, but I chose Amazon because it was familiar to Japan. Personally, I think that if paypal becomes more popular, it will be easier to boost local small-billing payments and help.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="docker">Docker</h1>
<p>Talking about Docker doesn&rsquo;t need to be explained here, but even if I omit the explanation, I can&rsquo;t go on, so I&rsquo;ll just introduce the superficial part without fear of misunderstanding. ..
Docker is characterized by low overhead virtualization and containerization of freely stackable environments. Please remember these two, virtualization and containerization. The technology of container virtualization existed before Docker, and in fact, there is a historical background that Docker also used an external container virtualization library in versions before 0.9, so only Docker is a dedicated container virtualization. Although it is not a patent, the master-slave relationship that container virtualization is a major feature of Docker is established.
First virtualization. Most conventional virtualization other than container virtualization uses the idea of a virtual machine and tries to virtually prepare anything from the CPU to anything. It was a technology that behaved as if there were a machine in the execution environment (also called the guest environment).
There, Docker virtualized the input and output of the file, here. We separated the execution environment by controlling the read/write part of the file and acting as if there was a dedicated machine there. This creates less overhead.
Then containerize. This means that if you turn off the power, you can rewind to this point and set the rewind point freely. Imagine a PC in which a fresh Windows is installed every time you turn off the power, making a rewind point with a fresh Windows.
Next, let&rsquo;s say you made a rewind point with Solitaire installed because it is not efficient. First Windows, Windows with Solitaire installed, and in Docker, the second layer container was stacked.
Next, I will install Netscape Navigator 4. You can install it on a clean Windows screen, or you can install it on the environment where Solitaire is installed. You will be able to choose which environment to stack. This is a stack of Docker containers.
This is a convenient point of containerization, in which you can stack what you need as much as you want, and restore it when you turn off the power.
Virtualization with little overhead and containerization that allows you to build a free environment and return anytime.
This is the good thing about Docker.
This time, we will fully utilize the benefits of this technology.</p>
<h1 id="machine-learning">Machine learning</h1>
<p>I proceeded with such a structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/3707/b34ddbee-d74f-943c-2d5b-8c03e6072797.png" alt="resebble_stock_python.png"></p>
<p>In machine learning, data is collected and predicted, calculated, verified based on the result, and predicted again.Therefore, data collection and machine learning are inevitable during development. It is often repeated. From the beginning, it can be difficult to design a service that is exposed.
Therefore, if I only designed each operation so that it was divided into folders, it was easy to use Flask as an API after adding only the machine learning part.
The trick is that when you start to think that you can publish it as a service as you repeat machine learning, if you keep the API entrance in mind and make it a function, you can easily use it as an API with Flask later. is.
You can also build a backend that will be described later, so Flask can be closed locally later in the Docker network. It is also convenient for the API side here to do the minimum sanitization and validation. Of course, you have to be careful about vulnerabilities that can be hijacked from the guest side of Docker, but since you can exchange data as an authenticated state, ** almost ** nothing is done here. Being able to transfer data without it is a great strength.
To repeat, doing almost nothing means that the minimum sanitization, validation, and certification have been performed. Please be aware that SQL using placeholders, doing nothing with root privileges, and doing the minimum normal things will be done. The definition of what is normal is also important, but since the story is too broad, let me omit it.</p>
<p>For reference, I will publish the code that is actually running. The code is crude, but I can&rsquo;t proceed if I&rsquo;m humble with the crude code, so I&rsquo;ll move on. What I would like to say is that if you manage it in a properly closed manner, you can operate up to production even with code that just passes like this.</p>

</code></pre></div><h1 id="data-part">Data part</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all right to make it a Docker container, but I also made the data a Docker container.
At first, I was planning to mount the data part as an external volume from Docker, but as you know many people, when you try to mount a host volume from Docker on linux, you need root privileges on the host side. The solution is to do something about the Docker container side or somehow on the Docker host side, but in my case, there is a gitlab-runner user operating on CI/CD of Gitlab. , There is an environment where that gitlab-runner is executed by sudo, that is, the situation of the user is different depending on the operating environment, so I obtusely locked it in Docker.
The good thing about making it a Docker container is that the portability of data has also increased, so a powerful scraping environment has been created along with the scraping part that follows.
For reference, I will introduce the Dockerfile of the data part.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-Dockerfile" data-lang="Dockerfile"><span style="color:#66d9ef">FROM</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> busybox</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">

</span></code></pre></div><p>It is a good point of sqlite that you can carry the entire DB environment as long as you keep the files as they are.
Also, as a table design of stock price data, there is a question such as whether to divide the table for each stock or to operate the stock code like GROUP BY code in one table, but there are good and bad points. It&rsquo;s hard to get it. This time, I tried to operate it with one brand and one DB. To access stock code 1234, access the DB for stock code 1234.
It takes a little overhead to access the stocks crosswise, but anyway this is also good and bad, so this time I did it like this. I will talk about the goodness and badness of the stock price DB design in a little more detail if I have the opportunity.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of operating the entire sqlite file as a Docker image is that the image needs to be recreated each time the data is updated, so if you do not do well in the CI/CD environment, the image will accumulate more and more. Portability is not so high, because it depends largely on the user&rsquo;s idea of whether or not to allow Docker-in-Docker (DinD), but if DinD is not used, update the data on the shell. Because it is a premise, after all, the execution environment is selected. If you don&rsquo;t like that, you have no choice but to focus more on the DinD environment, but this is how much you can bring DinD tuned to the production environment in the future, whether you should stabilize it in the shell environment, if you consider kubernetes There are many points to take into consideration, such as remaking with RDBMS sooner.
From a very personal point of view, although DinD was supported by the Docker formula, it was originally a use unexpectedly, historically, DonD can operate as a security hole of the host OS if it is poor. Since it is hard to say that the environment surrounding DinD is still complete, such as what you have to do, I try to touch the Dockerfile from the shell as much as possible. There is no doubt that it is a very convenient and powerful technology, so expectations are very high.
I took a quick look at all these things, and for now, when I prioritized moving, I thought it would be fine to make a whole image with sqlite.</p>
<h1 id="scraping-part">Scraping part</h1>
<p>Since the data we deal with this time is stock prices, improving portability in the scraping environment was a top priority. I always want to scrape the latest data, so I decided to use a Docker container without hesitation.
It&rsquo;s very convenient because you can automate the process of scraping when the container starts and dropping the container when finished, without thinking anything.
You can turn this with crontab as it is, or you can easily make EC2 start when the time comes, EC2 starts automatically when EC2 starts, and EC2 ends for each container when scraping ends.
It was all good, but finally, I prepared two main parts of the scraping part, one that can be executed with Docker and the other directly with a shell. Docker wasn&rsquo;t useful in all environments.
After all, the problem that the host side volume mounted by Docker becomes owned by root cannot be avoided, and in such an environment it was better to execute it with the host side shell.
So, if you can execute it directly in the shell, if the Python execution environment is covered by Docker, or if the scraping environment is done in the Docker container, we finally have 3 types of environments.</p>
<h1 id="front-end">Front end</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s a waste of machine learning to keep this work only for yourself, so I&rsquo;d like to see it published on the WEB and be widely used by everyone! If so, the next step is front-end development.
As a guideline for personally choosing a framework, I tend to choose a backend framework such as laravel when the backend development is heavy, and a frontend framework when not. Of course, depending on the case, there may be restrictions on the server that runs, so this is not the limit, but at least if you can freely choose, build from the front end as much as possible.
Again, since the most complicated part of machine learning is already done, I chose the configuration of Express.js + NuxtJS without hesitation because no more complicated back end processing is required.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/3707/f8864849-3ef8-856a-9024-cc60301864b9.png" alt="resemble_stock_front.png"></p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t want to say it&rsquo;s safe because it&rsquo;s closed. However, it is said that there is no way to see what is inside, from the outside, unless you take some other method such as a hack from the kernel. Think that experienced engineers feel easier to design.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good to turn it into a Docker container, but in the end I also turned it into a Docker container. Since there are many trials and errors during development, this is a part where the execution environment is fixed especially in the domain because I do not want to do things such as making it into a container and starting it, checking the log with the container, Node on the host side It couldn&rsquo;t be started with .js, or was the part packed up to the end.
However, in the end, I also locked everything here in a Docker container. The reason is that it becomes easier to interact with the backend, depending on the environment of the network, so I found it convenient to completely lock it down in the Docker network as well.
In the end, Docker opened only https, http port 443 and port 80, and made the form to interact inside the Docker network.</p>
<p>#AmazonPay
This is the hardest part, and the Amazon side also provides polite Japanese explanations and SDKs in various languages, so it&rsquo;s because my skill is insufficient, but it took a lot of time for development. ..
First of all, SDK has various languages, but there is no one for Node.js, so it took time to try whether it can communicate directly from Express.js. I wanted to try if I couldn&rsquo;t directly interact with the API using axios, but maybe my search is bad, I can only find a simple sample for direct communication with the API, and it is a tremendous time to find the correct answer with trial &amp; error. I used.
Because AmazpnPay only accepts communication from https under the domain registered in advance, so if you try one at this point, merge into the develop branch to add one console.log → gitlab-runner will run Wait for Docker container → Docker
After starting, I had to repeat the operation check in the browser → display the log of the operating container with Docker logs of the server that was SSHed, and I knew that it was not very realistic.
I may find a better way in the future, but what I can do in the current flow is to make an API that strikes the API with the provided SDK, so I chose the Python SDK this time.
The front end also had a little difficulty.
Since the design is based on the assumption that the loading and drawing timings are the same, it is not possible to load only the module in advance and generate the UI at the drawing timing. Furthermore, the life cycle of module destruction → generation is not taken into consideration, so it is extremely difficult to make a modification so that it is reloaded each time it is drawn, and I adjusted it to some extent using the life cycle of Vue.js. Since it is not the behavior expected by the creator of the thing, it became a little uneasy implementation.
This is fatal for the payment button that the viewer goes back and forth on the cart screen for the convenience of the viewer, and it has to be reloaded to redraw.The convenience of this creator is that the Amazon Pay button <a href="https://pwa.geekylab.net/index.html#/">at least the scratch pad is maintained 4 years ago</a> I have to say that the design is old. It&rsquo;s all complaining, but I think it&rsquo;s a very promising payment service, so I&rsquo;d like you to improve it.# What I want to say was that it was easy to make it a service with Docker
This time, all of the operation was accidentally done with Docker containers, but I felt that the method of making without thinking first and designing the container later has a high affinity for making machine learning a service. It was Since it is a container as a whole, it may be easy to introduce it in kubernetes when scaling the service in the future, and I think that it will make various progress.
This time, we are introducing various technologies across the board, but all of them are touching only the basics, so it may not be as good as it seems depending on how you look at them.
However, those who do machine learning may not know how to easily deploy using Docker, and those who do Nuxt.js may come up with a good way to use machine learning. We hope that the record of the technology introduced across this time will give us some hints.
I did not touch on the method of machine learning this time, but I will write an article on <a href="http://masamunet.com/2020/01/27/vbgmm-stock/">here</a> regarding how to handle stock prices with machine learning. It is written separately. If you like, please refer to that one as well.</p>
