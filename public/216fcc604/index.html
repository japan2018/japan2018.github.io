<pre><code># Article summary
</code></pre>
<p>I wanted to put the sales involved in the development with GitHub Flow, that is, the development with a simple pull operation, and created such an environment. At that time, I made and released a web application that supplements some missing functions, so I will write various stories about it.
(It&rsquo;s not about whether or not you can actually use this web app, but rather that you want to improve your development with a similar flow.)</p>
<p>#Webapp repository</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/uniaim-event-team/pullre-kun">https://github.com/uniaim-event-team/pullre-kun</a></p>
<p>For the time being, I wrote about the usage and functions of this web application in README.md, but in this article I will write it in order including a little background story.
We are currently accepting acclaim for issues and other additional development.</p>
<p>#Background</p>
<h2 id="common-development-issues">Common development issues</h2>
<p>So far, the following issues have been encountered in the additional function development of existing web applications (services).</p>
<ul>
<li>Some functions have not been fully verified</li>
<li>Insufficient lecture on how to use the added function / Only some people recognize it and become a ** hidden function **</li>
<li>Over time, everyone forgets the existence of that function and becomes a <strong>hidden function</strong></li>
<li>Actually, the development side will have to do the data setting work that can be registered normally if you use the screen</li>
<li>~~ In the first place, you can not register data from normal screen ** Create a hidden function ** and operate it ~ ~</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introducing-the-github-flow-the-flow-that-is-enriched-with-external-parts">Introducing the GitHub flow (the flow that is enriched with external parts)</h2>
<p>In order to solve such a problem, we examined the operation in the following flow.</p>
<img width="903" alt=" Screenshot 2020-03-29 16.20.09.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/94255/6d8f6ed3-605f-4477-4f2c-aaefc8622e54.png">
<p>A little stronger than the general similar workflow is that the ticket registrant writes the test scenario.
There were various parts that I was uncertain about, but I decided that I would trust it in terms of the following points, considering that it was technically possible or impossible.</p>
<ul>
<li>No matter how a sales person, when providing to customers, the minimum operation explanation on the management screen should be possible if required.</li>
<li>It is more natural to confirm that it can be used satisfactorily by end users and other users of the system without prior knowledge of technology.</li>
<li>Regarding the enumeration of items to be checked at that time, even if the sales side does not have the viewpoint of coverage, it should be possible to simulate what is actually done in front of the customer without technical knowledge. ..</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it goes without saying that it is not possible for the person who made the request/requirement to write an exhaustive test, so I will increase it on the development side if there is a necessary one. It is difficult to find out what kind of condition the branch depends on inside the system at the time when the requirement/requirement is issued, and it is not technically necessary to write a test that covers them. I decided it was difficult.</p>
<h2 id="issues-for-introducing-flow">Issues for introducing flow</h2>
<p>There were some technical issues in introducing this flow, but they were generally summarized in the following issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>In what environment does the ticket registrant verify?</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in the case of modification such as adding a table item, it is necessary to refer to the schema defined in the pull request.
It is not impossible to test in the developer&rsquo;s environment, but since the developer&rsquo;s development work continues, it is often assumed that it will not be usable during the test. Also, there is a possibility that it will not work properly due to the effect of another modification, which is not good for each other. In the first place, there is also the problem that testing with source that contains some other fixes is not a test for pure pulllik content.</p>
<p>Then, when it comes to creating a verification environment for it manually, one person may create multiple pull requests a day, and creating a verification environment for it each time is a bit difficult.</p>
<p>If you only need JS to fix it, there is something like netlify, but there are many problems in preparing the schema and dataset, and in the first place, since the server side is Python, it could not be applied.</p>
<h3 id="isnt-it-solved-with-docker">Isn&rsquo;t it solved with docker?</h3>
<p>In principle, it can be solved with docker, and there is a story that actually did the same thing with docker at least 3 years ago!
<a href="https://tech.toreta.in/entry/2017/02/24/210755">Mechanism that automatically builds the environment deployed with that commit ID when issuing a pull request and makes it easier to confirm at the time of review / before merge</a></p>
<p>Originally I wrote an automatic test and it was running with CircleCI, so it works with docker to some extent, but some processing does not work well just by making docker (specifically wkhtml is used to convert html to pdf In the process of converting to, I could not put the place where xvfb was used in the docker immediately&hellip;I did not run it in CircleCI either), I made a docker for it It&rsquo;s messy and it&rsquo;s up to now.</p>
<h1 id="what-you-actually-did">What you actually did</h1>
<p>The policy is as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a lot of verification instances in advance, set the load balancer and DNS, make normal access when the server process starts, and then turn off the instance</li>
<li>DB decides to share Aurora including development environment ** and create Aurora</li>
<li>If there is a pull request, pick it up and turn on the verification instance</li>
<li>On the verification instance side, identify the commit that the instance should check out and start the server process with that commit</li>
<li>Turn off the corresponding verification server when the pull request is closed</li>
</ul>
<p>This part that processes pull requests excluding pre-processing is the part that the web application supports.</p>
<p>The system configuration image is as follows. Controller Instance runs the web application, and Staging Instances regularly executes the batch process to start the server process.</p>

<h1 id="findings-after-actually-operating">Findings after actually operating</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a few weeks since it was in operation for the first time, and there are some parts that are different from the normal state due to the influence of the new corona, but for the time being, I thought that it was easier to test on the real screen. As a development verifier, it&rsquo;s very easy to be able to verify what you used to checkout in your own environment, modify the schema, and test while doing something without touching your own environment.
Also, I think it&rsquo;s a big improvement that it&rsquo;s easier to involve non-developers before the release.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-install-setup-web-application">How to install (setup) web application</h1>
<p>This is the same as the description in README.md. Almost almost Google translation.</p>
<h2 id="create-ec2-instance">Create ec2 instance</h2>
<p>Create an EC2 instance. And allow port 5250 to one of them. One is called a &ldquo;controller instance&rdquo;.
The others are called &ldquo;staging instances&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="create-iam-policies-and-users">Create IAM policies and users</h2>
<p>Create an IAM policy that allows the following actions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ec2: DescribeInstances&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ec2: StartInstances&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ec2: Stop Instances&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policy resource is the instance you created. (Note: DescribInstances are for all resources)
Then attach the policy to the user/role and save the access key and secret key.</p>
<h2 id="install-git">Install git</h2>
<p>Install git on the entire instance.
Note: If you are using amazon linux2,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo yum install git

<p>Install the requirements (contents of requirements.txt).</p>
<h2 id="run-get_basic_tokenpy">Run get_basic_token.py</h2>
<p>Controller instances have basic authentication. You need to create a token (hash) for your password and save it in app.ini.</p>
<h2 id="create-appini-file">Create app.ini file</h2>
<p>Create the app.ini file. The sample is app.ini.default. Then deploy it to the entire instance.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ cd ~/pullre-kun
$ nohup python3 app.py &amp;
</code></pre></div><h2 id="register-the-server">Register the server</h2>
<p>Visit <code>https://&lt;your-domain&gt;/server/list</code> to see the entire server.
Then click the Register Staging Server button.
Then access <code>https://&lt;your-domain&gt;/master/server</code> and update the db_schema for each record.## Register user</p>
<p>Access <code>https://&lt;your-domain&gt;/master/git_hub_users</code> and register users.
&ldquo;Login&rdquo; is the github user login and db_schema is the original schema of the clone.</p>
<p>With the above procedure, if there is a pull request, the verification environment will be automatically started.</p>
<h1 id="about-other-technical-explanations">About other technical explanations</h1>
<p>Flask + SQLAlchemy is used as a whole, but CherryPy is used as a server.
If you have a lot of hope, I may write a commentary soon. (The usage of general-purpose WTForm according to SQLAlchemy model is a little special)
