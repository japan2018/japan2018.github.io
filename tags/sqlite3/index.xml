      <description>#Introduction  It is convenient to be able to debug with software alone when measuring temperature with Raspberry Pi and acquiring sensor status with GPIO. Therefore, we created a debug environment that simulates temperature measurement and acquisition of sensor status with GPIO, and displays it on a website (created with Flask). Save the simulated temperature and sensor state in SQLite and refresh the page via Ajax. The temperature and sensor values are hard to understand, so it looks as if the living room temperature and sensor had changed.</description>
