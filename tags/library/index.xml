      <description># Python program is slow! I want to speed up! At that time...  When implemented in Python, the processing time may be too long to meet the requirements. In that case, there are four types of measures shown in this article.
If you do something to speed it up, you lose something else. Typical examples of trade-offs are freedom of expression, readability, dependency, memory usage, and CPU usage. Please follow the usage and capacity and use correctly.</description>
