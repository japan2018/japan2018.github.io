      <description>#Introduction  I have disturbed the empty frame of Production/Counting Advent Calendar 2019.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with SinGAN a lot lately, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to summarize the results. SinGAN is a paper that became a hot topic because it was selected as the best paper at ICCV 2019. It&amp;rsquo;s great for learning with just one image and generating images of any size with the same features. ![Screenshot from 2019-12-24 18-23-29.</description>

      <description># 1.First of all  This article is the 24th day article of Yuyuki AdventCalender 2019.
2. What you want to do  I want to go to the world of Yuyu â†’ I want to convert a facial photograph into a Yuyu style  Last year at Advent Calender, I tried automatic coloring of black and white cartoons with CycleGAN. (Trying to colorize manga in CycleGAN ~Yuyu ceremony~)) CycleGAN is good at style conversion such as changing colors and textures, but it is not good at shape conversion.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  This article is the 16th day article of Kinki University Advent Calendar 2019. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the decoction is, but I will generate a Pokemon image with Gan. In the future, I would like to add a description of Pokemon picture book to the generated image. The source code is here
DCGAN DCGAN was used for image generation. For details, see Papers. The implementation used DCGAN-tensorflow,butforsomereasontherewasabugintheofficialsourcecode,sofixed is used.</description>

      <description>### For people like this: point_up_tone1:  GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) was announced in 2014, but due to epoch-making research, there are many derivative researches recently, and what is it? .. I myself made full use of Google professor to do various research, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any Japanese literature that summarizes major related research in an easy-to-understand way, sorry! So, this article is for those who want to get an outline of the flow of GAN-related research, or for those who want to jump over each research ~~ one by one with quick and one-click jumping to the paper and code.</description>
