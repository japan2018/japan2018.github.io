      <description># Overview  I think it is very important to verify the effects after conducting various prototypes with WEB services, I think that basic statistics can be used enough as a method. This time, we summarized the method of statistical data analysis using Python+JupyterLab (Docker) for the purpose of basic statistics, verification of the effects of prototypes that can be used in business, and data analysis.
The notebook I used this time is also available below, so please refer to it.</description>
