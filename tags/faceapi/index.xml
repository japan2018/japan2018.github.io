      <description>I&#39;ve used it recently, so I&#39;ll write a little.  Since this is my first post, there may be many mistakes and missing parts. I would appreciate it if you could kindly teach me :girl_tone1:
Azure Face had a strong impression of face authentication, I thought it was interesting because I could recognize emotions, so I tried using it for emotion recognition.
#Azure Face *I used the python SDK.
What you can do: face verification, face detection, emotion recognition It seems that there are other ways to find similar faces, group with the same face, etc.</description>
