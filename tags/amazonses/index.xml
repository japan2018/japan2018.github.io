      <description>## Introduction  This is the 24th day article of Django Advent Calendar 2019. I wrote this article on Christmas Eve proud of myself thinking about Django. Lol
Even though I&amp;rsquo;m still a beginner, I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying Django, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been stuck for hours at some point (a little new way to do it?). Even if the reference was in English, there were no articles that were just right, so I decided to write this article with the feeling that &amp;ldquo;I do not want other people to stumbl here.</description>
