      <description>## What?  I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with quantum computers or Yokuwakara, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about Ising models, I&amp;rsquo;m not good at formulas like Î£, but I can read it with Python.
The source code is more intuitive than the mathematical formulas and can be understood by moving it anyway, so I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to try Python&amp;rsquo;s study of &amp;ldquo;quantum annealing&amp;rdquo;, which is one of the &amp;ldquo;quantum computers&amp;rdquo;. I summarized it as.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve visited once, but it&amp;rsquo;s quite crowded on holidays. In such a case, waiting time and traveling distance are the burdens in dreamland.
It would be ideal if there was a course where the waiting time and travel distance would be shortened. However, when it comes to thinking for yourself, it is necessary to accurately grasp the positions and waiting times of the enormous attractions.</description>
