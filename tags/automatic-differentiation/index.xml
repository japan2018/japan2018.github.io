      <description>2020/1/27 Post  0. Target audience of this article  People who have touched python and have a good execution environment People who have touched pyTorch to some extent People who want to know about automatic differentiation by backward with machine learning with pyTorch People who want to know that pyTorch can not be backward  1.First of all Recently, the main focus of research on machine learning is the python language, because python has many libraries (called modules) for high-speed data analysis and calculation.</description>
