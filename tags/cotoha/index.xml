      <description>#Introduction  Human communication includes not only language but also many non-verbal information such as facial expressions and gestures. When analyzing and interpreting human behavior mechanically and programmatically, more information can be obtained by adding meaning to such non-verbal information. These technologies are being researched and developed in various fields such as image processing, natural language processing, and voice recognition, and are expected to be applied in many fields such as marketing and robot interaction systems.</description>

I like all the works, but it&amp;rsquo;s useless even if this kind of hand is too far from the original material, and the best taste is to keep the shape and meaning similar to the original material and to have a sense of jerk I wonder if it is.</description>
