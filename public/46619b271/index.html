<p>(2020/4/30) The article structure was reviewed and the &ldquo;latest update&rdquo; was added to the original article &ldquo;[The story that when I made a cycle computer with Gachi, I was able to make it fairly]&rdquo; (https://qiita .com/hishi/items/8f77fd4655027fac7c7d)”.</p>
<p>It will be the 22nd day of <a href="https://adventar.org/calendars/4172">Road Bike Advent Calendar 2019</a>. This is a technically unusual post, but I would appreciate your favor.</p>
<p>The author has been working on making a cycle computer from scratch for several years. Since I arrived at a certain shape in the spring of 2019, I will publish &ldquo;[The story that I made a cycle computer with Gachi, I was able to make it quite]](<a href="https://qiita.com/hishi/items/8f77fd4655027fac7c7d)%22.did.~~Actually,itwasanapplicationforMakerFaireTokyo2019,soIwroteitwithalotofpoemingredients,butIwasdefeatedwonderfully(lol">https://qiita.com/hishi/items/8f77fd4655027fac7c7d)&quot;.did.~~Actually,itwasanapplicationforMakerFaireTokyo2019,soIwroteitwithalotofpoemingredients,butIwasdefeatedwonderfully(lol</a>) ~~</p>
<p>Thank you very much for this post itself, so I decided to transcribe the sequel because it was an opportunity this time.</p>
<p>This time, the recipe (<a href="https://github.com/hishizuka/pizero_bikecomputer">Program</a>+howtoassemble) will be released, so please try your hand and try it! We would appreciate if you could feel the new pleasure of creating your own device from a small single computer.</p>
<p>Since the volume of articles has increased considerably, I will send detailed explanations of the program later on <a href="https://twitter.com/pi0bikecomputer">Twitter</a>. Thank you for your support.</p>
<p>(2020/4/29) &ldquo;The latest update&rdquo; is mentioned in the first article &ldquo;<a href="https://qiita.com/hishi/items/8f77fd4655027fac7c7d">A story that I made a cycle computer with Gachi, but I was able to do it</a>&rdquo; and deleted from this article.</p>
<p>#Introduction
With Raspberry Pi Zero W, I am making a cycle computer for sports bicycles. For the functions and hardware configuration being implemented, read &ldquo;[The story that I made a cycle computer with Gachi, I was able to make it quite]](<a href="https://qiita.com/hishi/items/8f77fd4655027fac7c7d)%22">https://qiita.com/hishi/items/8f77fd4655027fac7c7d)&quot;</a> Please give me.</p>
<p>It looks like this now. The Topeak smartphone case is used as a substitute and is waterproof to some extent.

<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/100741/82ab2373-eaf5-e4c9-29ad-4a8a842a496c.png" alt="title-01.png"></p>
<p>Since there is no outer case, the buttons are a little hard to press, but you can use it normally.
In 2019, data of over 2,500 km (= roughly 50 km half day on Saturday and Sunday × 4 weeks × 12 months) were obtained.
(I miss the days when I was able to run over 200km on Saturdays and Sundays without any worries&hellip;)</p>
<p>#How to make
Well then, it&rsquo;s time to show off the recipe.
It&rsquo;s quite long, so please use it when you have time.</p>
<h2 id="confirm-start-on-pc">Confirm start on PC</h2>
<p>First, try starting the software on your PC.</p>
<p>###Things necessary</p>
<ul>
<li>python (version3 series) execution environment</li>
<li>pip3 command</li>
<li>Python programming skills, skills to install required packages</li>
<li>git command</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="until-startup">Until startup</h3>
<p>Take it from the repository with the git command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone https://github.com/hishizuka/pizero_bikecomputer.git
</code></pre><p>Make a copy of the initialization file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cd pizero_bikecomputer
$ cp install/setting-orig.conf setting.conf
$ cp layouts/layout-cycling.yaml layout.yaml
</code></pre><p>Install the required packages. <a href="http://www.pyqtgraph.org">PyQtGraph</a> has been partially modified, so please install the one from my repository.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ pip3 install PyQt5 numpy oyaml pillow
$ pip3 install git+https://github.com/hishizuka/pyqtgraph.git
</code></pre><p>Check if it can be started.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$python3 pizero_bikecomputer.py
</code></pre><p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/100741/f8eeed99-878d-817e-21e7-543c985f0009.png" alt="app-01.png"></p>
<p>With the &ndash;demo option, numbers may or may not appear properly.</p>
<p>The directory and setting file (setting.conf) necessary for the first startup will be created, so please close it once.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use">How to use</h3>
<p>The buttons at the bottom of the screen are as you can see, but the following functions are assigned in order from the left.
(Actually, short press/long press can be changed)</p>
<ul>
<li>Left (←) button: Move between screens</li>
<li>Lap button: Lap. When stopped, press and hold to reset and output the fit file (changeable) under the log folder.</li>
<li>Menu button: described later</li>
<li>Start/Stop button: Transition between start and stop states. Press and hold to end the program.</li>
<li>Right (→) button: Move between screens</li>
</ul>
<p>Next is the menu screen. As of 2019/12, I have not made it yet, so please do not expect it (laugh)
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/100741/43df2bd6-2af9-16cd-f356-a30ede21d63a.png" alt="app-02.png"></p>
<p>I think you can imagine it,</p>
<ul>
<li>ANT+ Sensors
-With the ANT+ library inserted, and at the beginning of the [ANT] block in setting.conf, set <code>status = True</code> to enable pairing with various sensors.
-When the program ends, the information required for pairing is output to setting.conf, so the next time it starts, it will automatically connect.</li>
<li>Wifi BT
-Press the button to switch ON/OFF.
-I haven&rsquo;t seen how much battery life lasts when it&rsquo;s turned off. .. ..</li>
<li>Update
-I will update the program. Actually, you just do <code>git pull origin master</code> in update.sh.</li>
<li>Strava Upload
-Upload button to Strava. The setting is complicated, so I will write it later.</li>
<li>Wheel Size
-If you can use the ANT+ speed sensor, enter the wheel circumference in mm. Used for distance calculation. The default is 2,105 mm, which is the tire circumference of 700x25c. The entered value is recorded in setting.conf.</li>
<li>Adjust Altitude
-If you connect a barometer with a Raspberry Pi (hereinafter referred to as the actual machine), you can increase the accuracy by entering the altitude of your current location.</li>
<li>Power Off
-Used to turn off the power on the actual machine.</li>
<li>Debug log
-You can refer to the debug log. However, because it is a hard work, you can only scroll with the scroll bar, and the usability is very poor.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the major features of this program is that it can be developed on a PC without writing a program that directly draws the screen on the actual machine. The pressure sensor and GPS values cannot be confirmed unless they are real devices, but it is much more efficient to write the screen and main logic on a PC.</p>
<p>Then, once you have reached this point, the next step is to display it on the actual desktop!</p>
<p>##Raspberry Pi Zero + Pi TFT version</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get around 10,000 yen, which I introduced in &ldquo;[I made a cycle computer with Gachi, but I was able to make it fairly]&rdquo; (<a href="https://qiita.com/hishi/items/8f77fd4655027fac7c7d">https://qiita.com/hishi/items/8f77fd4655027fac7c7d</a>) Let&rsquo;s actually make a cycle computer with such a configuration.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/100741/086beca3-6042-069b-4eb4-4991a0498d3c.png" alt="pitft-01.png"></p>
<p>*The Pioneer SGX-CA600 is placed on the left for the purpose of size comparison.</p>
<p>###Things necessary</p>
<p>####hardware</p>
<p>There are quite a lot, so please do your best, or buy them in Akihabara!</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi Zero (W, WH) (around 1,000 yen)
-For setup, refer to my article &ldquo;<a href="https://qiita.com/hishi/items/8bdfd9d72fa8fe2e7573">Raspberry Pi Zero(W, WH) setup</a>&rdquo;</li>
<li>TFT LCD module with touch screen
-PiTFT 2.4 inch recommended (less than 5,000 yen)
-Again, please set up with &ldquo;<a href="https://qiita.com/hishi/items/bdd630666277e4f8162a">Using PiTFT with Raspberry Pi Zero(W, WH)</a>&rdquo; etc.
-Assumes X Window is visible</li>
<li>GPS module (2,000 yen ~, optional)
-<a href="http://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/gK-09991/">Akizuki Denshi module</a> is probably the best choice as an introduction
-It is assumed that it can be used with GPSd. The setup will be described later.</li>
<li>ANT+ USB dongle (around 1,000 yen, optional)
-Please procure as a set with micro USB conversion connector</li>
<li>I2C sensor (optional)
-<a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro-phat">Enviro pHAT</a>(around2,000yen) is appropriate, but production is suspended.
-I2C sensor is widely supported via CircuitPython which is a library provided by adafruit, but it can be used even if it is not an adafruit module as long as the chip and address are the same.-Barometric pressure sensor is compatible with BMP280/BMP38X/LPS33HW/LPS35HW, acceleration/gyro/geomagnetic sensor is compatible with LSM303/LSM6DS/LSM9DS1/LIS3MDL/BMX160, and illuminance sensor is compatible with TCS3472/VCNL4040. The button is <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/button-shim">button_shim</a>,thepowersourceis<a href="https://uk.pi-supply.com/products/pijuice-standard">PiJuice</a>,<a href="https://uk.pi-supply.com/products/pijuice-zero?lang=ja">PiJuiceZero</a> is supported.
-See below for setup.</li>
<li>Exterior related
-Topeak&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.topeak.jp/bag/acz23200.html">SmartPhone DryBag</a>. Recommended around 5 inches.
-Slim USB micro cable. It is even better if it is an L-shaped type.</li>
<li>mobile battery. If you have 3000mAh, you can use the PiTFT version for 8 hours.</li>
<li>Screw nut
-It is used for fixing between boards, but it is very important in operation.
-Reuse the extra kits or buy M2.5 or M2.6 screws and nuts.
-If there is a length of about 6 mm and a length of about 15 to 20 mm, it is probably rock solid.
-Since it is not sold separately, it will be unexpectedly expensive if you arrange it&hellip;</li>
<li>SD card
-For now, you can use your own (8GB or more).
If you use it every week, you will die in about a year. I am currently using SanDisk&rsquo;s high durability version 32GB, and it has been good for a year.</li>
<li>Tools required for work
-Soldering iron, solder
-Jumper wires and lead wires
-Insulation tape (cellophane tape, etc.)
-Nippers, etc. (Is it possible to maintain the bicycle?)
-Space where you will not get angry even if you get scented with solder (same as above)</li>
</ul>
<p>####skill</p>
<ul>
<li>Skill to handle soldering iron
-Speaking of a bicycle, it is probably okay if you have the dexterity to exchange wires</li>
<li>Skill that allows you to check the operation of individual parts by referring to the distributor&rsquo;s HP (skip appropriately in this article)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="other">Other</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unbreakable heart</li>
<li>Financial power to buy several sets in case of damage to parts
-I love the above set for one or two GP5000 (luxury tires for road bikes), so I love it&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>###assembly</p>
<p>The main ingredients are like this.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/100741/7d798ce9-8b76-18b1-09c7-85f068903f89.png" alt="assembly-01.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Upper left: PiTFT 2.4 inch</li>
<li>Middle left: Raspberry Pi Zero WH</li>
<li>Lower left: Enviro pHAT</li>
<li>Middle right: GPS module (not introduced above, just in case)</li>
<li>Lower right: ANT+ USB dongle and micro USB conversion connector</li>
</ul>
<p>I will assemble these.</p>
<p>If you find it difficult, we recommend that you first check that the PiTFT is working, then check the GPS module, Enviro pHAT, and ANT+ USB dongle one by one, and then step by step.</p>
<p>Also, at first, it is better to connect the GPS module and Enviro pHAT using jumper wires that can be easily removed from the GPIO pins inside the PiTFT.
If you want to make it as compact as possible, like the author, remove extra pins as much as possible and perform complicated and strange aerial wiring, but be aware that this kind of magical modification takes time and effort.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/100741/f632a516-466c-3ee7-c217-aed050ece23f.png" alt="assembly-02.png">
Attach the Enviro pHAT and ANT+ USB dongle. Enviro pHAT has a sensor on the printed side, so it&rsquo;s better to point it outside. (If it is inside, it will pick up more heat from the CPU.) Also, insert the ANT+ USB dongle into the micro USB terminal on the inside.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/100741/427c55a8-9927-036f-5f4f-2ad5eb544720.png" alt="assembly-03.png">
The Enviro pHAT is wired directly where needed.
The famous pHATs in the world can tell you what pin you are using on the <a href="https://pinout.xyz/pinout/enviro_phat">Raspberry Pi Pinout</a> site.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/100741/82984a06-6b9d-8afb-3a58-4c5566dd8f3a.png" alt="assembly-04.png">
Connect PiTFT 2.4 inch.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/100741/d44e58a8-52af-7a7b-1ca5-3c4f5be92493.png" alt="assembly.png">
The PiTFT 2.4 inch has GPIO pins protruding from the side, so you can connect with jumper wires.</p>
<p>It looks like this when you make it completely.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/100741/2f63cc6d-8e14-0320-3227-6e05fa8851cd.png" alt="pitft-02.png">
Each part is fixed with screws. The button on the PiTFT is pushed from the top, so if you don&rsquo;t fix it, you will sometimes push it too much and the connection with the main unit will be cut off.
The ANT+ USB dongle and power cable are fixed with tape to prevent vibration. I haven&rsquo;t had any problems since I arrived at this method. If there is a gap between the connector and the board, insert a suitable cushioning material and fix it with tape.</p>
<p>I want to make my prototype as thin as possible, so I have removed all GPIO pins that are facing out in the PiTFT. (There are two vertical lines between the ANT+ dongle and GPS in the lower right center of the above photo.)</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/100741/5aa2428a-9252-4941-5599-a5a8038be925.png" alt="pitft-03.png">
Moreover, it does not use the pin socket on the PiTFT side, but is directly soldered to the Raspberry Pi Zero WH.</p>
<h3 id="until-first-boot">Until first boot</h3>
<p>We assume you have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspbian Buster installed (not Lite)</li>
<li>User is pi</li>
<li>Somehow accessible from PC (via USB or Wifi)
-Wifi is better if you can connect the tethering of the workplace and the smartphone. The latter is insurance when you want to check on the go.</li>
<li>PiTFT is connected and X Window can be displayed.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have done this far, the goal will be close.</p>
<p>First, login with SSH and change some settings with raspi-config.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo raspi-config
</code></pre><ul>
<li>&ldquo;1 Change User Password&rdquo;
-Change your password.</li>
<li>&ldquo;2 Network Options&rdquo;
-Change the host name as necessary in &ldquo;N1 Hostname&rdquo;. It is better to change when operating multiple units. However, note that the login host name also changes.
-Wifi connection settings can be made with &ldquo;N2 Wi-fi&rdquo;.</li>
<li>&ldquo;4 Localization Options&rdquo;
-In &ldquo;I2 Change Timezone&rdquo;, select the time zone of your country (Asia-&gt;Tokyo in Japan) so that the time zone reflects the time. Check with the <code>date</code> command.</li>
<li>&ldquo;5 Interfacing Options&rdquo;
-&ldquo;P4 SPI&rdquo; and &ldquo;P5 I2C&rdquo; should be ON if PiTFT is available, but it is a prerequisite. If you use the sensor of I2C connection, &ldquo;P5 I2C&rdquo; is ON.
-&ldquo;P6 Serial&rdquo; is required when using the GPS module. Set &ldquo;Would you like a login shell to be accessible over serial?&rdquo; to No, and &ldquo;Would you like the serial port hardware to be enabled&rdquo; to Yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>When this is done, reboot (<code>sudo reboot</code>) once.</p>
<p>Next is the update festival.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo rpi-update
$ sudo apt-get remove piwiz
$ sudo reboot
</code></pre><p>At this point, there should be no apps that fill the screen on startup.
(Because of password change, initial setup wizard piwiz)</p>
<p>Here is the installation festival.
Again, we will carry out the installation procedure done in &ldquo;Startup confirmation on PC&rdquo; and the procedure specific to Raspberry Pi together.</p>
<p>Take it from the repository with the git command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cd $ HOME
$ git clone https://github.com/hishizuka/pizero_bikecomputer.git
$ cd pizero_bikecomputer
$ cp layouts/layout-cycling.yaml layout.yaml
</code></pre><p>Install the required packages. Raspbian Buster seems to be included from the beginning except cython.
<a href="http://www.pyqtgraph.org">PyQtGraph</a> has been partially modified, so please install the one from my repository.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip cython3 cmake gawk python3-numpy python3-pyqt5
$ sudo apt-get install wiringpi python3-smbus python3-rpi.gpio python3-psutil python3-pil
$ sudo pip3 install oyaml
$ sudo pip3 install git+https://github.com/hishizuka/pyqtgraph.git
</code></pre><p>(Added on April 30, 2020) Please install the following to stabilize sqlite3 connection.</p>
<pre><code class="language-consolesudo" data-lang="consolesudo"></code></pre><p>Install the backlight control program and shutdown program for PiTFT 2.4.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">(Backlight control program for PiTFT 2.4)
$ sudo cp install /usr/local/bin/disable-pitft /usr/local/bin/

(Reflect on service)
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable disable-pitft.service
</code></pre><p>Check if it can be started at this point. The first command is a spell to launch on PiTFT.</p>

<p>Thank you for your hard work.</p>
<p>Since it is very difficult to use if it is started from the terminal every time, I will make it easy to start from the screen later.
Exit from the terminal with ctrl-c.</p>

<h4 id="when-using-gps">When using GPS</h4>
<p>Install GPSd service and package used by python.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo apt-get install python3-tz gpsd gpsd-clients python3-pyproj

$ sudo cp install/etc/default/gpsd /etc/default/gpsd
$ sudo systemctl restart gpsd
</code></pre><p>To check whether GPSd is running correctly, check if the value is set with the <code>cgps</code> or <code>gpsmon</code> command. If you leave it outdoors for a few minutes, you can supplement GPS and information such as latitude and longitude will come to flow.</p>
<p>When using ####ANT+</p>
<p>As with PyQtGraph, openant has some modifications, so please install the one from my repository.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0 python3-usb
$ sudo pip3 install git+https://github.com/hishizuka/openant.git

<p>When you come here, it&rsquo;s time to take a break! (The second smell of odor)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s used as a small device rather than a desktop computer, so it&rsquo;s auto-launched or added with an easy-to-press launch button.</p>
<p>For the time being, only perform the former automatic startup, and add buttons as necessary.
If there is no button, it is a problem when it freezes in the middle, and in that case, it will be SSH login from the smartphone and manually enter the restart command or restart.</p>
<h4 id="automatic-startup-x-window">Automatic startup (X Window)</h4>
<p>It ends with the following three lines. Buster as of 2020/1 is a prerequisite. It may not be possible if the version etc. changes.</p>

<p>It is smarter to do it directly without using X, but when starting directly with PyQt5 installed with the apt command without using X, the touch panel does not seem to work, so build Qt5 and PyQt5 with tslib enabled. is needed. If you really want to use a touch screen, get 4GB of Rasberry Pi 4 for compilation. This will be described in the sequel.</p>
<h4 id="button-addition">Button addition</h4>
<p>(It&rsquo;s quite long, so skip it if not needed)</p>
<p>Since it is impossible to change the settings on the small PiTFT desktop screen, change the screen settings via VNC.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo apt install tightvncserver
$ tightvncserver :1

(When terminating tightvncserver)
$ $ tightvncserver -kill :1
</code></pre><p>After setting the login password, log in with VNC.
For Windows, install VNC Viewer (<a href="https://www.realvnc.com/en/">RealVNC</a>etc.). The server name is the same as that for connecting with SSH etc., and the port is 5901 version.</p>
<p>Since macOS is included by default, press &ldquo;Connect to server&rdquo; (command + k) at the bottom of the Finder&rsquo;s move menu, and log in with vnc://raspberrypi.local:5901.

There is no harm in using it in normal resolution, but when using 320x240, it is all superfluous, so I will erase it.<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/100741/1b4a1072-0e4f-08f3-a371-9b36f4992a65.png" alt="vnc-02.png">

Next, since there are too many menus, I will also delete this. Launch the Main Menu Editor in Preferences.</p>

With Applications on the upper left selected, clear the check boxes for each menu in the center except for Preferences.
Next, make an item with the second button New Item from the top right.</p>

Reboot and check from the screen of the actual device.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-1">How to use</h3>
<p>The hardware buttons are roughly aligned with the software screens.
From left to right:
(You can change both short press and long press. Also, only GPIO number of PiTFT 2.4 is supported. For other models, it needs to be changed in modules/config.py)</p>
<ul>
<li>Screen brightness On/Off button.</li>
<li>Lap button. When stopped, press and hold to reset and output the fit file (changeable) under the log folder.</li>
<li>Screenshot button. Output below screenshot folder.</li>
<li>Start/Stop button. Transition between start and stop states. Press and hold to end the program.</li>
<li>Right button to move between screens. Press and hold the menu screen</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the assignment is changed on the menu screen. The following assignments are made from left to right.</p>
<ul>
<li>Return</li>
<li>No allocation</li>
<li>Confirm button</li>
<li>Move between items (forward direction)</li>
<li>Move between items (reverse direction)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your hard work. Now you can run outside.</p>
<h3 id="until-you-start-running">until you start running</h3>
<p><strong>Course file</strong></p>
<p>If you want to use it, place the TCX format course.tcx file under the course folder. The file name is fixed now. If the file exists at startup, it will be read.</p>
<p><strong>Mounting on a road bike</strong>
Attach the case to the handlebar and connect with the battery in the top tube bag. Since there is no particular switch, it starts up the moment you connect it. Just in case.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/100741/5157c02c-0fe2-c6bb-ab7b-d1e1965f10c2.png" alt="bike-01.png"></p>
<p><strong>After starting</strong>
It will take a few minutes to supplement GPS, so let&rsquo;s wait in a place where the sky is open as much as possible.
Meanwhile, ANT+ pairing and altitude correction will be performed if necessary.</p>
<p>Press the start button to start recording, press the lap button as appropriate to measure the section, press the start button again to end recording, and then press and hold the lap button to reset and write the recording.
Please take out the recorded file via SFTP. The method of uploading to STRAVA in one shot will be added soon.</p>
<p>#in conclusion</p>

<p>What did you think? ‥</p>
<p>We would be grateful if you could share your impressions in the comments or on <a href="https://twitter.com/pi0bikecomputer">Twitter</a>. I would like to refer to those who have tried in particular, so I would appreciate it.</p>
<p>This hobby project is doubtful that it is still at the starting point because we have not implemented many high-impact features that are not available on the market, but we are planning to continue working on it in the future, so if you are interested, please join us.</p>
<p>The documentation has not caught up at all, and I would like to explain how to start directly without X, MIP color reflective LCD version, and program description, but this is another opportunity.</p>
