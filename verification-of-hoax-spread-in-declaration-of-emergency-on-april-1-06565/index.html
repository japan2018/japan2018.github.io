<pre><code>#Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>On the evening of March 30, 2020, rumors spread that the government would issue an emergency declaration on April 1 and lockdown the city on the next two days.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://fij.info/">FIJ (Fact Check Initiative)</a>, which promotes the spread of fact check in Japan, this issue is taken as one of the unreliable information.</p>
<p><a href="https://fij.info/coronavirus-feature/national#nhk0330-1">Government announces emergency on April 1st, lockdown on 2nd – spread via LINE, etc.</a></p>
<p>At a press conference that evening, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kan clearly denied the rumor <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>March 30, 17:58: <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20200330/k10012357971000.html">Chief Secretary: &ldquo;City blockade&rdquo; information on the net &ldquo;No such fact&rdquo; | NHK News</a></p>
<p>In addition, the news that Prime Minister Abe denied the rumor was reported that night.</p>
<p>March 30, 20:11: [Emergency Declaration &ldquo;Asatte Declaration&rdquo; is a hoax] Prime Minister Abe | NHK News](<a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20200330/k10012358391000.html">https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20200330/k10012358391000.html</a>)</p>
<p>I was interested in finding out when this rumor spread so much that the Prime Minister and the Chief Cabinet Secretary could not overlook it. As data, it is a news site and it is easy to verify the diffusion phenomenon, and even individuals can easily obtain it <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference/get-search-tweets">Twitter search API</a> is used.</p>
<p>As we will see later, the source of this rumor is speculated to be LINE, so this verification using only Twiitter and other publicly available data can only capture part of its essence. In addition, please note that this verification also contains my own thoughts and delusions.</p>
<h1 id="data-set">data set</h1>
<p>I mainly used Twitter&rsquo;s search API as data to validate when this rumor spread and what might be the cause. As for this case, rumors were supposed to be true (because of the issuance of a declaration of an emergency and the blockade of the city <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>), but it is expected to buy up at supermarkets in the neighborhood, so it is only for relatives and acquaintances. It is expected that LINE will be actively used instead of Twitter due to the desire to convey this rumor, but since LINE information is not available, it is excluded as a candidate for dataset.</p>
<p>In the NHK News at 17:58 on March 30, 2020, Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga made a “city blockade”, and in the news on the same night, Prime Minister Abe denied rumors about an “emergency declaration”. We have collected tweets that mention these words around the 30th of each month.</p>
<p>Specifically, for the period from 2020/03/27 00:00 to 2020/03/31 23:59, Twitter API was inquired using the search condition of &ldquo;Lockdown OR City blockade OR Emergency declaration&rdquo;, and about 120 I got a million tweets. The results are shown below <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. The horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents the number of tweets.
Also shown are the local linear trend model estimates for the same data and their 95% prediction/confidence intervals.</p>

<p>In the trend component graph in which the periodic component is removed from the estimation results, it is possible to confirm the rising trend that cannot be seen on other days on the evening of March 28 and 30th.</p>
<h1 id="source-of-rumor">Source of rumor</h1>
<p>It is speculated that the above-mentioned rising trend is mainly due to chain mail being carefully ventilated by FIJ and various news sites.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/byline/shinoharashuji/20200330-00170566/?fbclid=IwAR2cnS6qOVv7UFc3x4TcUHVF_dTTiuLKiF_P_jJCu_KKH7nU54nSVC">Chain mails &ldquo;Enter lockdown from April 1st&rdquo; appear mainly on &ldquo;LINE&rdquo;. Be careful because it&rsquo;s a hoax (Shuji Shinohara)-Individual-Yahoo! News</a></p>
<p>As mentioned in this article, the source of the chain mail is supposed to be LINE. You cannot check the origin of chain mail because you cannot access the LINE data. Also, there is no way to verify that this chain mail was the cause of the diffusion phenomenon of words such as &ldquo;emergency declaration&rdquo; (on Twitter).
After that, we will proceed with the assumption that chain mail was the cause of the spread phenomenon.</p>
<p>This time, on the premise that chain mail was the cause of the diffusion phenomenon, on the 30th instead of the 29th or the 31st, until the reason the Prime Minister decided to deny it in the media, &ldquo;Emergency declaration&rdquo; and &quot; I investigated whether the word &ldquo;lockdown&rdquo; spread.</p>
<h1 id="hypothesis-about-the-cause-of-spread">Hypothesis about the cause of spread</h1>
<p>Chain mail, which is the cause of this diffusion phenomenon, is considered to be a type of fake news, as it is said to be a hoax.</p>
<p>To verify fake news, <a href="https://www.publicdatalab.org/">Public Data Lab</a>,whichisworkingtosolvesocialissuesusingdata,created&rdquo;<a href="https://fakenews.publicdatalab.org/">AFieldGuideto“FakeNews”andOtherInformation.Disorders</a>&quot;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> was referenced. In addition to the traditional method of counting likes and retweets, &ldquo;A Field Guide to Fake News&rdquo; proposes a method that focuses on the situation and the actors involved in the spread of the news. This is because existing focus is on the context behind the spread of fake news, such as &ldquo;who&rdquo; was spread for &ldquo;what&rdquo; purposes, &ldquo;who&rdquo; was involved there and &ldquo;why&rdquo;. It differs from the method.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if this rumor, &ldquo;Emergency Declaration on April 1,&rdquo; is ideology of specific individuals or groups, or so-called fake news involving interests, but focus on the context behind diffusion This is expected to lead to more diverse consideration results, so we will verify according to this method.</p>
<p>Not only this time, in general, it is considered that the diffusion degree at the present time causes the diffusion degree at a later time. The trend in the figure above also illustrates this well. However, since there is no upward trend on 29th and 31st days, and the rising trend can be confirmed, but the 30th day is more prominent than 28th, we can imagine the existence of an additional cause.</p>
<p>This time, I assumed that the cause was a tweet that had a large number of retweets around the time. The more retweet tweets are based on the idea that they will have more of a positive/negative impact on the spread after their posting time.
The reason for choosing this assumption is that the data is readily available and then the problem setup can be simplified. There are countless possible causes and combinations such as news sites, Facebook, and the spread of viruses, but we cannot verify all of them. Generally speaking, when you say modeling, you should use the simplest element that can express your hypothesis most accurately, but this time, whether the element (data) is available in the first place, resources of my computer etc. , This setting is made due to a constraint outside the essence.</p>
<h2 id="inspection-result">inspection result</h2>
<p>Regarding the tweets with the highest number of retweets near the evening of March 30, we will verify whether they caused the spread of tweets containing words such as &ldquo;emergency declaration&rdquo; and &ldquo;city blockade&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This time we considered the simplest model. In other words, the above-mentioned local linear trend model with the number of tweets as an observation value is added as a regression term with a binary value as to whether or not a tweet that has acquired a certain number of retweets has already been tweeted at that time as an exogenous variable. Saw. (This regression coefficient is estimated by maximum likelihood estimation due to the resource of the calculator.) The threshold of the number of retweets is heuristically examined and set to 1,000 or more. The results are shown below.</p>
<p class="codepen" data-height="819" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="p-baleine" data-slug-hash="WNvBVXM" style="height: 819px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen- title="WNvBVXM">

</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>The circles on the graph represent each tweet with more than 1,000 retweets, and the Y axis on the right corresponds to the regression coefficient of the estimated model. The size of the circle corresponds to the number of retweets for each tweet. Also, at the top of the graph, the titles of past news articles selected from [NHK NEWS WEB](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/) have been added.
<p>Below are the AIC <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> for the local level model, the local linear trend model that incorporates the periodicity (above), and the model that incorporates tweets with 1,000 or more retweets as exogenous variables. From the viewpoint of model selection, the model that took in tweets with 1,000 or more retweets as exogenous variables was the best model.</p>

</table>
<p>You can see that there are more tweets than normal during which the regression coefficient is positive on both the 28th and the 30th when the upward trend was seen. However, these results could not explain why there was an uptrend on the 28th and 30th, and why it was more visible on the 30th than on the 28th. Perhaps by comparing the contents of the tweet with a positive regression coefficient and the tweet with a negative regression coefficient, it may be possible to get some hint, but this time we did not go beyond that verification. not.</p>
<p>We also believe that this model has the following problems due to its simplicity:</p>
<ul>
<li>The regression coefficient of exogenous variables is calculated by maximum likelihood estimation. Since it is unlikely that the tweets with 1,000 or more retweets will have the same effect after being posted, it would be more natural to treat them as time-varying variables that change over time.</li>
<li>Treats tweets with 1,000 or more retweets as exogenous variables. In the first place, these tweets should have been posted by being influenced by the number of tweets, which are the objective variables, to some extent, so it may be too rough to ignore them all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, this time I mostly use only Twitter data, but I think that you can consider models that use other information sources (for example, models that incorporate each NHK NEWS WEB article as an exogenous variable). I will.</p>
<h1 id="in-conclusion">in conclusion</h1>
<p>Regarding the rumor that “the government will issue an emergency declaration on April 1st” on March 30, 2020, I searched the tweets containing similar words for the reason why it spread.</p>
<p>What I really wanted to do, and what I would like to see is to be able to understand the effects of rumors and fake news on the Internet on everyone&rsquo;s psychology in a way that makes sense to me. is. From a macro perspective, “trends” are just that, but as shown in “A Field Guide to “Fake News” and Other Information Disorders,” the relationships, interests, and motivations of people involved in the spread of fake news I&rsquo;m interested in visualization including such things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s limited to fake news, but of course, no one is happy about family, friends, or any information that could be detrimental to oneself, which is why spreading such fake news slows down cool decisions. I think it will be an opportunity. It&rsquo;s just my observation range, but I didn&rsquo;t see a phenomenon like buying up at the supermarket in the neighborhood since March. However, on the evening of this day (3/30), the daily necessities and the shelves of rice were out of stock compared to usual, and I felt a feeling of impatience for buying up in the store.</p>
<p>Also, if you look at the text of the chain mail that is now calm, you can see that it is like a textbook that no one normally deceives. At the end of this message, there is an instruction to transfer the message to an acquaintance, which can be regarded as a typical example of chain mail (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%81%E3%82%A7%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%83%A1%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB#%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8D%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E4%B8%8A%E3%81%AE%E9%A1%9E%E5%9E%8B">Wikipedia:Chain mail</a>)<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.
(If you receive this message, please check the text, there are many other mysterious points.)
Nonetheless, if the rumors are spreading on the net and the supermarket in the neighborhood is out of stock, for example, some people may be fooled (I was fooled about half. )</p>
<p>Perhaps if you read up to this point, I will understand, but I am completely out of the ordinary in both time series analysis and fake news. If there is something wrong, I would be really happy if you could point it out. However, as an amateur, I am interested in what kind of behavior a group of people will take when they are indirectly connected via the Internet in a situation where they feel intimidated, and I can not study this time. I worked on the matter.
When I actually tried it, I needed more computer resources than I expected for both information gathering and inference, so I could only verify a few models. Other tasks (such as diving on the net or tampering with Emacs or doing work occasionally) will not be possible, so I would like to do resource-consuming tasks such as inference in the cloud, but the preceding one&hellip; :sweat:</p>
<p>Also, if there is a theme that interests you, and if you also have energy and resources (I have time, :moneybag:), I would like to challenge.</p>
