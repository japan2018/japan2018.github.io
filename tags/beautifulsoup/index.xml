      <description># Purpose  Data collection is a pain. I thought that I would like to analyze boat racing in the future, so as a practice of data collection Odds table of official boat racing site.
Overview  I can only think of a convenient language = python for scraping, so I use python3.7. Python 3.7 is called beatutiful soup ~~ It seems a little erotic ~~ It seems that the library with the name is convenient for scraping By using the beautifulsoup css selector, you can specify the location of the table without deciphering the html one by one!</description>
