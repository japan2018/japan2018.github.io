      <description>#Introduction  Hello everyone.
Do you use a matching app? ! I feel good as one of those who have recently matched with a matching app.
By the way, the matching app I was using was able to refer to the data of other popular members. (Probably people who have received more than 100 like are displayed.)
When I saw it, I was disappointed.
&amp;ldquo;Like, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get 100&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; ** &amp;ldquo;I want to be a man who exceeds 100&amp;rdquo; **</description>
