</p>
<pre><code>## Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>It was just over a month and a half ago that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a>,thecreatorofPython,quitDropbox,whereheworkedforsixandahalfyears&hellip;Itissaidthathewillnotchangejobsandwillberetiredasitis.63yearsold.Thankyouforallyourhardwork.I&rsquo;vebeenaPythonBDFL(<em>BenevolentDictatorForLife</em>) over a year ago, and it doesn&rsquo;t have a big impact on Python development, but it&rsquo;s a bit sad.</p>
<p>He started making Python in December 1989, exactly 30 years ago. He wanted to do hobby programming on Christmas holidays, so he decided to create an interpreted language, and that was what Python was today.</p>
<p>Python that was released as 0.9.0 in 1991 also overlapped versions, 2.0 in 2000, 3.0 in 2008, Python 2 and Python 3 are developing in parallel, at the moment 2.7.17 and 3.8.0 Is coming up. Support for Python2 will end this year, so only Python3 will be maintained and upgraded in the future. However, the release cycle has changed! I will talk about it, so I will write about it a little.</p>
<p>The original story is a PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) called <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0602/">PEP 602 &ndash;Annual Release Cycle for Python</a>.</p>
<h2 id="previous-release-cycle">Previous release cycle</h2>
<p>Exporting 3.1.0 or later, where the release interval has stabilized, is like this.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Version</th>
<th>Release Date</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>3.1</td>
<td>2009-06-27</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.2</td>
<td>2011-02-20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.3</td>
<td>2012-09-29</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.4</td>
<td>2014-03-16</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.5</td>
<td>2015-09-13</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.6</td>
<td>2016-12-23</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.7</td>
<td>2018-06-27</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.8</td>
<td>2019-10-14</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Although there are some places around, it seems that it is released at a cycle of about one and a half years when I look at it. And the development of one version started when the previous version β came out, so it took almost two years since the development started as a whole. This is a bit too long, so a new release cycle proposal has been proposed and adopted.</p>
<h2 id="new-release-cycle">New release cycle</h2>
<p>First of all, the main feature of this release cycle is &ldquo;<em>every year</em> we release a new version of Python&rdquo;. Every year in October, a new version is released with a cycle of one and a half years until now. Therefore, the scheduling is like this.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Phase</th>
<th>Period</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Development</td>
<td>5 months (overlap with previous β/RC period)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>α version</td>
<td>7 months</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>β version</td>
<td>3 months</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RC version</td>
<td>2 months</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Development overlaps with the previous version, and the period of α + β + RC is exactly 12 months, so it can be released every year. In other words, as soon as the official version of the previous version comes out, the next version α comes out! Up until now, it had been more than half a year since the previous release, so it&rsquo;s a great thing.</p>
<p>It may be difficult to understand, so this is what it looks like in the figure.
![Screenshot 2019-12-15 9.22.37.png](<a href="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/30342/175cdd19-0b92-1526-02c6-(c5c33d92b8bb.png)">https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/30342/175cdd19-0b92-1526-02c6-(c5c33d92b8bb.png)</a></p>
<p>And the support period after the release is clearly decided like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>18 months (1 and a half years) after the release, minor bugs will be updated once every 2 months with bug fixes. Binary release for Windows and Mac.</li>
<li>For the next 42 months (3 and a half years), we will make security fixes as necessary. Source code release only.</li>
<li>Support ends 5 years after release.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="python-39-looks-like-this">Python 3.9 looks like this</h2>
<p>The schedule for Python 3.9 has already been decided on <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0596/">PEP-596</a>, and it looks like this.</p>
<p>3.9 Start of development: 2019-06-04 (Completed)
3.9.0 alpha 1: 2019-11-19 (completed)
3.9.0 alpha 2: 2019-12-16
3.9.0 alpha 3: 2020-01-14
3.9.0 alpha 4: 2020-02-17
3.9.0 alpha 5: 2020-03-16
3.9.0 alpha 6: 2020-04-13
3.9.0 beta 1: 2020-05-18 (No new features added after this)
3.9.0 beta 2: 2020-06-08
3.9.0 beta 3: 2020-06-29
3.9.0 beta 4: 2020-07-20
3.9.0 candidate 1: 2020-08-10
3.9.0 candidate 2: 2020-09-14
3.9.0 final: 2020-10-05</p>
<p>As you can see, the first alpha version is already out. Up to now, there were only 4 alpha versions, but now there are 6 which seems to make up for the shortened development period. I think it&rsquo;s a good change that it has become an agile approach, where features are gradually added while being released as an alpha version and used.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I have summarized the new release cycle introduced in Python 3.9. I think it was good that the cycle became shorter and new functions could be used in a timely manner.</p>
