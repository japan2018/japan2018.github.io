      <description>This article is from the 13th day of Django Advent Calendar 2019.  In this article, I would like to summarize Django&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Class-based Generic View&amp;rdquo; and its inheritance class relationships.
Premise I refer to and cite the official documentation of Django 3.0, which is the latest version at the time of writing this article.
What is a Class-Based Generic View? First, a &amp;ldquo;view&amp;rdquo; in Django is an encapsulation [^1] of logic that processes user requests and returns responses.</description>

      <description>This article is about how I learned machine learning by Nikkei xTECH Business AI② Advent Calendar 2019 __.

I would be happy if it could be used as a reference for as many people as possible. I usually write for individual blogs, and I was warmly thinking about writing on my blog, but I thought it was a great opportunity, so I posted it on __qiita for the first time __.</description>
