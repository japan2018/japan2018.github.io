      <description>Deep learning with #C# (matrix calculation)  This time, I created only the program that calculates the matrix necessary for deep learning. The book I referred to is &amp;ldquo;Making Deep Learning (O&amp;rsquo;Reilly)&amp;rdquo; from scratch. This book is very easy to understand and I think it is a good book, so I recommend it. It&amp;rsquo;s not a manga, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop&amp;hellip;I was so interested. Since I have only read about half of it, there are many things I do not understand well, but this time, I made a matrix calculation program in C#.</description>
