YouDev is a service that focuses on individual developers to let them know more about them (I want to know&amp;hellip;).
Even if the service is recognized, I think that the developers have not hit the spot, so individual developers may not only appeal the services released by themselves, but also the developers themselves. I created it.
I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for individual developers, so I&amp;rsquo;m an individual developer!</description>

      <description># Article summary  I wanted to put the sales involved in the development with GitHub Flow, that is, the development with a simple pull operation, and created such an environment. At that time, I made and released a web application that supplements some missing functions, so I will write various stories about it. (It&amp;rsquo;s not about whether or not you can actually use this web app, but rather that you want to improve your development with a similar flow.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  A layer corresponding to each runtime version can be created with the docker-lambda build image!
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/var/task lambci/lambda:build-python3.8 \ &amp;gt; pip install -r requirements.txt -t python/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ Software packages that you want to run on AWS Lambda can be layered with yumda!
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/git-layer:/lambda/opt lambci/yumda:2 yum install -y &amp;lt;package&amp;gt; Preparing the environment from scratch is quite difficult A common caveat with AWS Lambda and Lambda Layers is the handling of native binaries.</description>

      <description>Make a washing and drying timer using # RaspberryPi  Introduction (purpose of production)  Because I work for a company, I am often absent during the day, and I can not take in the laundry when it rains. For this reason, laundry is basically dried indoors. However, since the clothes drying room is not sunny and the drying does not proceed as expected in winter, the timing of taking in may be missed, and the laundry accumulates in a snow dharma fashion, creating a vicious cycle.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  This article is AWS Beginner Advent Calendar 2019 This is the 14th day article. I would appreciate if you could point out any mistakes.
wrap up In Boto3, there are resource APIs (which are called with boto3.reosurce(&amp;lsquo;service name&amp;rsquo;)) depending on the service. The resource API is more abstract than the client API and can be implemented without writing unnecessary information, so if each API can do the same, it is better to use the resource API first.</description>

There are two ways to load it, the first is to zip up the installed libraries and executable files in a zip file and upload to lambda, and the second is to load lambda as a layer. The latter method is recommended, but in this article, these methods are summarized as Tips together with the aspect of code management.</description>

      <description># My background  Amazon? Ah, you know, you know, a mail order app. Not long ago, knowledge about Amazon was that much. Of course, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know AWS.
I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed as an information undergraduate student. 
However, as a 3rd year university student, I was introduced to the lab and learned about AWS. In addition, I am addicted to the topic &amp;ldquo;Atsuhiko Nakata&amp;rsquo;s YouTube University&amp;rdquo;, which is a hot topic in this street.</description>

      <description>The other day, at the wedding reception of an acquaintance, I was asked for entertainment for the first time, and I managed to survive.  What should I do I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to own. Singing and dancing are not masters. I can make some movies, but it seems to be done by the side of the bride. .. : Only programming! !

      <description># Low-level API and high-level API  It is boto3 which is aws python library, but there is a low level API which is a naive API and an object oriented high level API which wraps it.
Manipulating S3 Objects with Boto3 (High Level API and Low Level API)-Qiita https://qiita.com/sokutou-metsu/items/5ba7531117224ee5e8af
I used to use the low-level API client.list_objects_v2 to output the list of S3, but there is a corresponding high-level API, resource.</description>

      <description>My name is mogken and I am in the business planning office of an IT venture company.  Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about changing jobs, and I&amp;rsquo;m studying programming to make it appeal to me. It&amp;rsquo;s not so appealing to say that you&amp;rsquo;re just studying with your mouth, so I made a simple web app with Python and Django, built it on AWS, and released the source to Github.
This time, I would like to explain the program (Python) I wrote myself, which also serves as an output for the fixation of knowledge within me.</description>
