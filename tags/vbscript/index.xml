      <description># Motivation for this article #  Last year, I changed jobs from a production engineering job to a data analysis job, and I have more opportunities to write Python. I am currently involved in a project to develop a preprocessing tool for machine learning. Meanwhile, looking back when I was working as a production engineer, I thought that there were various tasks that could be automated . Based on the knowledge of Python obtained after changing jobs and the knowledge of the days of production engineers, I will describe the material that can be used when working again at the manufacturing site.</description>
