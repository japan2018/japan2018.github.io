      <description>2020/1/27 Post  0. Target audience of this article  People who have touched python and have a good execution environment People who have touched pyTorch to some extent People who want to understand optimizer SGD with machine learning by pyTorch People who want to use optimizer SGD of pyTorch for other than Network model (normal variables etc.)  1.First of all Recently, the main focus of research on machine learning is the python language, because python has many libraries (called modules) for high-speed data analysis and calculation.</description>
