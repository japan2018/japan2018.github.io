<pre><code>#Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>The productivity and soundness of a software development team can be understood as an internal sensation, but it is difficult for an external person to see it. This information asymmetry has caused problems in relationships with people outside the development team.</p>
<p>Also, for EMs, CTOs that bundle multiple development teams and products, and visualizing each situation with objective numbers and graphs, it is important reference information when considering the overall strategy. However, as the number of questionnaires and project management is increased, the burden on the development members becomes more and more, and the fatigue due to over-measurement is also induced.</p>
<p>In this article, I created a tool ``gilot&rsquo;&rsquo; to generate some graphs from the log information of the git repository and visualize the situation of the team, so I will explain its purpose, intention, usage and notes. I will.</p>
<h1 id="approach-method">Approach method</h1>
<p>Gilot&rsquo;s approach analyzes git log data to see how stable the development team&rsquo;s output is, how much output it has, how many people are actually committing, etc. , Visualize. We can&rsquo;t immediately judge productivity or soundness, but we expect it to be a strong piece of evidence.

<h2 id="using-version-control-system-logs">Using version control system logs:</h2>
<p>From the viewpoint of visualization of productivity and soundness, there have been many attempts to visualize them through project management tools and questionnaire surveys. These are also important pieces of information for visualization, but in recent years there has been an increase in attempts to utilize the information of version control systems as another source of information in software projects.</p>
<p>The version control system log is</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural activity information is recorded without the actual developer being aware of it.</li>
<li>Unified analysis is possible regardless of programming language type and environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of its advantages, it has attracted attention in the world of empirical software engineering.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/use-of-relative-code-churn-measures-to-predict-system-defect-density/">Microsoft Research&rsquo;s code churn estimation of defect density</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/bugspots">Bugspots</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these, I used to identify the places where &ldquo;many people&rdquo; make &ldquo;a lot of modifications&rdquo; to visualize the technical debt of my project, and then weight the technical debt. I have implemented it with the method of doing and used it to improve management.</p>
<p><a href="https://gihyo.jp/dev/serial/01/perl-hackers-hub/000803">Perl Hackers Hub 8th point: Point of large-scale system development and design by Perl (3)-Visualization of technical debt</a></p>
<p>At that time, I used svn and git, but from those blame results</p>
<pre><code>SRP=R+U+((L/100)-5)

R: Unique number of revisions
U: Unique number of modified users
L: Number of module lines
</code></pre><p>So, I searched for modules that violated the single responsibility principle.</p>
<h2 id="stability-using-gini-coefficient">Stability using Gini coefficient</h2>
<p>Gilot visualizes &ldquo;how stable the commit amount of the team is&rdquo; using <strong>Gini coefficient</strong>.</p>
<p>The Gini coefficient is an economic indicator of inequality. It approaches 1 when the income disparity increases and approaches 0 when it decreases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value of the Gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, and the larger the coefficient value, the larger the disparity in the group. In particular, when the Gini coefficient is 0, the Lorentz curve matches the even distribution lines, and the income of each person is uniform and there is no disparity. On the other hand, the Gini coefficient of 1 means that the Lorentz curve is aligned with the horizontal axis, and only one person is monopolizing all the income of the group. The warning line for frequent social upheavals is 0.4.
wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B8%E3%83%8B%E4%BF%82%E6%95%B0">Gini coefficient</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, let&rsquo;s calculate the Gini coefficient by using the fable of &ldquo;If the world is a village of 100 people&rdquo;, which is a little nostalgic, in order to imagine the Gini coefficient a little more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Out of all wealth
6 people have 59%
Everyone is from the United States
74 people have 39%
20 people share only 2%
Quoted from &ldquo;If the world were a village of 100 people&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see from this story, the world seems unequal and biased towards some people. How can we quantify this degree of bias? The Gini coefficient is used as one of the methods.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/35671/01cfde07-478c-962f-32e3-a08379ca6944.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>We will sort by category from the bottom and plot the cumulative ratio of wealth and the cumulative ratio of population. The curve connecting these points is called the Lorentz curve. On the other hand, the straight line assuming that all people have the same wealth is called the uniform distribution line.</p>
<p>The Gini coefficient is expressed by the ratio of the part B that is the integral of the difference between the Lorentz curve and the uniform distribution line, and the part A that is the integration of the uniform distribution line. The inequality increases as the inequality increases. In the example of this village, it is 0.59.</p>
<h3 id="predicting-the-health-of-social-games-using-the-gini-coefficient">Predicting the health of social games using the Gini coefficient</h3>
<p>Such Gini coefficients have also been used to measure the health of social games. Only a few core users pay heavily, and the percentage of light users remains low. As the disparity increases, the game becomes less interesting. In a healthy community, there are hopes that it may beat or reverse strong users. If there is too much difference, it will not be interesting.</p>
<h3 id="teams-with-large-and-small-gaps-in-commit-amount-per-unit-time">Teams with large and small gaps in commit amount per unit time</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the economic disparity that is paying attention on gilot. Nor is it the difference in the amount of commits made by individuals. The focus is on how the &ldquo;overall commit amount&rdquo; for &ldquo;a given time slot&rdquo; varies.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s consider a case in which over 100,000 lines were rewritten in one of the two weeks of the past year, but the source code was barely touched in the other two weeks. Such a situation obscures the heavy development cycle, the release process that affects health, and the labor of manual testing due to insufficient automated testing.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the planning phase and the development phase are extremely separated, or if a large amount of changes occur towards that time in order to carry out a roadmap-oriented development process such as development towards the end of the year or the end of the year, the Gini coefficient It is large and the gap is widening.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a stable team that repeats continuous improvement tends to merge faster into &ldquo;production&rdquo; and &ldquo;release&rdquo; branches such as master and has shorter branch lifespan. The more continuous integration and deployment you have, the more stable your source code will be.</p>
<p>This kind of stable output can be one of the evidences that the team is in good health. Regarding developer productivity, the amount of source code itself is not a direct fact at all, but the ratio to the whole, the degree of modification, the change over a period of time, etc. become statistical indicators worth looking at. think.</p>
<p>How to use # gilot
I will introduce how to use the tool developed this time.
GitHub is here: <a href="https://github.com/hirokidaichi/gilot">https://github.com/hirokidaichi/gilot</a></p>
<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
<pre><code>pip install git+https://github.com/hirokidaichi/gilot
</code></pre><h2 id="simple-usage">Simple usage</h2>
<p>gilot has three subcommands. Use it in combination with a pipe.
To create a graph from a repository, simply do the following:</p>
<pre><code>gilot log REPO_DIR | gilot plot
</code></pre><p><code>gilot log</code> will generate csv from the target repository. <code>gilot plot</code> will generate a plot from that CSV.
Since <code>gilot log</code> will take some time, it is recommended to output the CSV file once and save it, and then execute <code>gilot plot</code> on it.</p>
<pre><code>gilot log REPO_DIR &gt;repo.csv
gilot plot -i repo.csv -o graph.png
</code></pre><p>If you just want stats instead of images</p>
<pre><code>gilot log REPO_DIR | gilot info &gt;stats.json
</code></pre><p>, You can use the <code>info</code> subcommand. The output is in json format.</p>
<pre><code>gilot log REPO_DIR | gilot info | jq .gini
</code></pre><p>By combining with the jq command, you can obtain only the necessary statistical information such as displaying only the Gini coefficient.</p>
<h2 id="specify-period-specify-branch">Specify period, specify branch</h2>
<p>You can specify the period to get the information of git log.
There are two specification methods, and there are two options, <code>--month</code>, which specifies how many months the data will be acquired and <code>--since</code> which can be specified from when. The default is 6 months.</p>
<pre><code>gilot log REPO --since 2020-01-20 -o REPO.csv
gilot log REPO --month 18 -o REPO.csv
</code></pre><p>You can also specify the branch from which to get the logs. By default, <code>origin/HEAD</code> is referenced and the equivalent to master is specified, but specify according to the branch operation method of the development team. As many people as possible can touch it, and a branch with the same code base as the released or production system is desirable due to the nature of the tool.</p>
<pre><code>gilot log REPO --branch develop -o REPO.csv
</code></pre><h2 id="when-a-team-is-operated-across-multiple-repositories">When a team is operated across multiple repositories</h2>
<p>Modern teams often find that one team manages multiple repositories to provide one system.
Even more so with a microservices architecture that doesn&rsquo;t have a mono-repo configuration, one repository could be modified by many repositories.</p>
<p>In such a case, the results of each repository can be combined and evaluated. The simple way is as follows.</p>
<pre><code>gilot log repo-a &gt;repo-a.csvgilot log repo-b &gt;repo-b.csv
gilot plot -i repo*.csv
</code></pre><h2 id="use-as-a-library-of-python-and-use-in-notebook">Use as a library of Python and use in notebook</h2>

The Lorentz curve and Gini coefficient of the committed row quantity for each time slot are displayed.</p>
<p>There is no unified indicator of whether the Gini coefficient is less than or equal to safe or not. My personal observation is that if it is 0.5 or less, there is stable team output, and if it is large, some factor may be preventing stable code output.</p>
<p>It may be better to compare this value when there are multiple business systems, rather than focusing on the absolute value. There may be a big difference between what is called legacy and what is recently made and developed by the team.</p>
<h2 id="fig2-distribution-of-commit-amount-per-time-slot-2-weeks">fig.2: Distribution of commit amount per time slot (2 weeks)</h2>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/35671/ec4c580c-0c5d-b65b-a85a-3b937a6a667c.png" alt="image.png">
A histogram of the code output for a given timeslot. When the peak becomes a gentle mountain, it is easier to understand the stability of team activities.</p>
<p>If there are many outliers, there is a possibility that they will be affected by major functional modifications, refactoring, inventory removal, etc.</p>
<h2 id="fig3-actual-number-of-addeddeleted-lines-per-time-slot-2-weeks-and-the-difference">fig.3: Actual number of added/deleted lines per time slot (2 weeks) and the difference</h2>

Changes in the number of deleted lines/added lines/total changed lines for each time slot. The more green areas there are, the more functions are added, and the red areas indicate the possibility of refactoring or inventory.
The ratio of the number of deleted lines to the total number of changed lines is displayed as a refactor index. However, please note that it is not a refactoring because it is just a ratio.</p>
<h2 id="fig4-number-of-committed-developers-per-time-slot-2-weeks">fig.4: Number of committed developers per time slot (2 weeks)</h2>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/35671/e794b664-1189-358d-fc07-385cdac83397.png" alt="image.png">
The more a large organization develops, the harder it becomes to understand how many people are actually involved in software development.
In order to visualize those situations, the average value and the transition of the people who committed in a certain two weeks are displayed. You can see the number of humans (including bots&hellip;) Who are constantly working on the repository, including the case where only a small number of people are involved due to additional posts.</p>
<p>If you want to get more detailed information, you can get the data using the info command as follows.</p>
<pre><code>gilot info -i.csv | jq .authors
{
  &quot;mean&quot;: 13.357142857142858,
  &quot;std&quot;: 4.70036238958302,
  &quot;min&quot;: 4,
  &quot;25%&quot;: 10,
  &quot;50%&quot;: 15,
  &quot;75%&quot;: 16,
  &quot;max&quot;: 21
}
</code></pre><p>If the standard deviation is large or the difference between max and mean is large, it may be a metaphor for an unhealthy state.</p>
<p>#Notes and means for understanding the actual situation</p>
<p>The output of gilot is only statistical data of activities against the repository. It is for observing and assessing the actual condition of teams and systems in the form of physical examination or at the same level as thermometry every morning. It&rsquo;s not a tool for having it ill or unhealthy.</p>
<p>If you want to make more detailed evaluations or comparisons, it is better to use the DX Criteria survey items published by the Japan CTO Association. This is a full-fledged dock for the system and the entire enterprise.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cto-a/dxcriteria">DX Criteria</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While the use of data for business intelligence is being called for, engineering intelligence (data analysis and visualization of software development) will also become important in the future. Please use it as one tool for that.</p>
<h1 id="expectations-for-utilization">Expectations for utilization</h1>
<p>This tool makes visualization of repository status easy. Since the information contains almost no sensitive information, it may be safe to publish it externally. Rather, it would be convenient to know that we are like this, if you get on the recruitment page in real time so that we can understand that we are developing systems like this.</p>
