<pre><code>#Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>Recently, the development of natural language processing technology has been remarkable and is being applied in various fields.
Although I often do business using natural language processing technology and AI, the most troublesome (but important) work is related to various preprocessing.</p>
<p>The main pre-processing that you will perform for most tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning
<ul>
<li>Removes noise in text such as HTML tags and symbols</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Normalization
<ul>
<li>Full-width/half-width and unification of capital letters and small letters</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>** sentence segmentation **
<ul>
<li>Detects sentence breaks and splits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wordization
<ul>
<li>Split sentence into a sequence of words</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remove stopword
<ul>
<li>Remove unnecessary words for the task you want to solve</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I mainly use Python, but I didn&rsquo;t have a suitable library for ** Japanese sentence breaks **, and I had to write similar code every time.
I was wondering that there might be about 100 people in the world who had similar problems, so I thought about writing a library by myself and releasing it as OSS. It&rsquo;s about time.
However, I was unable to secure the time and motivation, and I was delayed, but by setting the limit to write articles on the Advent Calendar, I was finally able to start.</p>
<h1 id="specific-sentence-breaks">Specific sentence breaks</h1>
<p>I think the following is more commonly used as a simple sentence delimiter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate with a line break</li>
<li>Separate with a symbol (.!?, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, in many real-world documents, the simple rules above do not break well.</p>
<h2 id="there-are-punctuation-marks-and-exclamation-marks-in--and-">There are punctuation marks and exclamation marks in &quot;&rdquo; and ().</h2>
<p>For example, <code>I answered &quot;Yes. That's right.&quot; If you simply separate the text like </code>with punctuation, it will be split as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>I said &ldquo;Yes.</li>
<li>That&rsquo;s right.
*&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this may be a good situation, but I answered &ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Sometimes you want to treat it as a single sentence, `.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-a-line-break-in-the-middle-of-the-sentence">There is a line break in the middle of the sentence</h2>
<p>For example, I think that the line break may occur in the middle of the sentence as follows because it doesn&rsquo;t fit on one screen (especially for documents in companies).</p>
<pre><code>In natural language processing,
Generally used.
</code></pre><p>If this is separated by a line feed, it will be divided into two sentences, but in natural language processing, it is common to use ~omission~. You may want to separate it as one sentence called `.</p>
<p>In the above example, if you delete the line breaks and then delimit it with punctuation, it will do something, but it will be much more troublesome if you **include a sentence without proper punctuation.
(~~ Please give me some punctuation, please~)</p>
<h2 id="quote-block-for-emails">Quote block for emails</h2>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; I was planning to go to the barber tomorrow
&gt;&gt; Change the schedule. Therefore, of the meeting
&gt;&gt; Please change the date. &quot;.

I've acknowledged.
</code></pre><p>A case where there is an unnecessary sign at the beginning of a line and a line in the middle of a sentence. There is a theory that it is the most common case in documents within a company (subjective).
The approach that removes the symbols and line breaks first and then handles seems to be the easiest.
However, it is rare that you want to combine while removing unnecessary symbols and leaving information that it is a block of citations.</p>
<h1 id="related-techniques">Related techniques</h1>
<h2 id="ginza">GiNZA</h2>
<p>There is <a href="https://megagonlabs.github.io/ginza/">GiNZA</a> as a library that can also be used for Japanese sentence breaks in Python.
Sentence breaks using GiNZA can be done as follows.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-Python" data-lang="Python"><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> spacy
nlp <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> spacy<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>load(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;ja_ginza&#39;</span>)
doc <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> nlp(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;I was told, &#34;I can&#39;</span>t answer your thoughts<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> I want you to hit the other<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34; I was stunned </span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\n</span><span style="color:#e6db74">I just had to sit there, but I still want to believe!&#39;)</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> sent <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> doc<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>sents:
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">print</span>(sent)
</code></pre></div><pre><code>I said, &quot;I can't answer your thoughts.
I want you to hit others.
&quot;They said!
I was stunned and had no choice but to sit there.
Still I want to believe!
</code></pre><p>The advantage of using GiNZA is that it can detect sentence breaks with high accuracy even if there is a line break in the middle of a sentence or a punctuation is omitted because dependency analysis is properly performed. ..
It&rsquo;s a heavyweight class, but I think it&rsquo;s a good option if you want to use other features of GiNZA together.</p>
<h2 id="sentence-splitter">sentence-splitter</h2>
<p>Although it is a tool made by Node.js, there is also a <a href="https://github.com/azu/sentence-splitter">sentence-splitter</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;echo -e&#34;</span> said, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;I can&#39;t answer your thoughts. I want you to hit the other!&#34;</span> I was stunned and I had to sit down there, but I still want to believe! <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;| sentence-splitter
</span></code></pre></div><pre><code>Sentence 0: I was told &quot;I can't answer your thoughts. I want you to hit the other!&quot;
Sentence 1: stunned
I had no choice but to sit there, but I still want to believe!
</code></pre><p>This tool also uses the parser used inside <a href="https://github.com/textlint/textlint">textlint</a> for advanced analysis, so even if there is a line break in the middle of a sentence, the accuracy will be high. It&rsquo;s divided high.
I also like the fact that &quot;&rdquo; is my favorite and the processing performance is quite fast.
(I would have adopted it if it was not Node.js)</p>
<h2 id="pragmatic-segmenter">Pragmatic Segmenter</h2>
<p>It is a Ruby library, but there is a <a href="https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_segmenter">Pragmatic Segmenter</a>.
It is a library that separates sentences by rule base, and it has a big advantage that it is <strong>multilingual</strong>. Another advantage is that it does not perform complicated analysis, so processing is fast.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese sentence segmentation rules are close to my tastes, the goal of this tool development is to be able to segment Japanese sentences at least as well as Pragmatic Segmenter.</p>
<p>As for this tool, <a href="https://www.tm-town.com/natural-language-processing">Live Demo</a> is prepared, and the results of trying it are shown below.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;
&lt;wrapper&gt;
&lt;s&gt;I was told, &quot;I can't answer your thoughts. I want you to hit others!&quot; &lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s&gt;Absurd&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s&gt;I had no choice but to sit there, I still want to believe! &lt;/s&gt;
&lt;/wrapper&gt;
</code></pre><p>By the way, this Python version of Pragmatic Segmenter is being developed as <a href="https://github.com/nipunsadvilkar/pySBD">pySBD</a>.
Unfortunately, it seems that the Japanese rules have not been ported yet.</p>
<h1 id="made">Made</h1>
<p>So, the library I made this time is released at ↓.
<a href="https://github.com/wwwcojp/ja_sentence_segmenter">https://github.com/wwwcojp/ja_sentence_segmenter</a></p>
<p>In making the library, we developed it with the following goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can handle sentence breaks in the above cases</li>
<li>Flexible to some extent</li>
<li>Fewer dependent libraries</li>
<li>Processing speed is moderate, and we want to reduce memory usage</li>
<li>Add type hint to enable static inspection</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-use">How to use</h1>
<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/ja-sentence-segmenter/">Published on PyPI</a>, so it can be easily installed with pip.
It supports Python 3.6 and above, and there is no dependent library so far.</p>
