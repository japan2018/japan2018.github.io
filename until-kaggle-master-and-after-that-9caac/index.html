<p>**12/13 I added the time and study time for each! **
**12/18 We revised the part until it became Kaggle Master! **
**12/20 Added some parts! **</p>
<h3 id="purpose-of-the-article">Purpose of the article</h3>
<p>In this article, I will introduce you to what I have done since I started to study programming until I became a Kaggle Master.
I will also share some of the things that made me happy to become a Kaggle Master, and I hope that it will give you an opportunity to increase your motivation to work on Kaggle.</p>
<h3 id="biography">Biography</h3>
<p>When I first started Kaggle, I was wondering what kind of background had become a Kaggle Master, and what I was studying, so I&rsquo;ll briefly introduce it!</p>
<p>I am a third year undergraduate student at the age of 21, but I think he is a relatively hobbyist person.
When I was a high school student, I belonged to the photography club and I like cameras, so I got the Kendama Test Level 1 and played the card <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njstvj2M0WA">Cardistry</a>. I was playing with it.
When I think about it, I think I&rsquo;m relatively good at learning something.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/479928/3c975bb9-e22d-51c0-158d-f67491be5a90.jpeg" alt="IMG_1114.jpg">
(I like the pictures that show my hobbies and fountain pens)</p>
<p>Before I entered university, I was interested in probability statistics and aimed to become an actuary who plays an active role in the insurance industry.
Therefore, when I was in my first year, I mainly studied economics and actuary mathematics, but I feel that this experience is useful for data analysis.</p>
<p>In this way, until the summer vacation of the second year undergraduate, I do not do machine learning or programming other than lessons (I was not good at learning), but I would like to be able to handle data efficiently as an actuary. So I decided to study Python during the summer vacation.
Since then, I have been interested in machine learning and continue to study until today.</p>
<p>From beginning to study #Python until joining a Kaggle competition</p>
<h3 id="work-on-pyq-may-2018-mid-september-2018-4hday">Work on PyQ (May 2018-Mid September 2018 4h/Day)</h3>
<p>First of all, I wanted to learn from basic grammar easily, so I searched for a site where I could study online.
I met there <a href="https://pyq.jp/">PyQ</a>.
I&rsquo;m really grateful not only because I learned the basic grammar through this site, but also because I realized what machine learning is and what it is my area of interest.
Perhaps I wouldn&rsquo;t even try Kaggle if I didn&rsquo;t study on this site.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/479928/b276b3c6-9164-1ccc-7ff9-8e62e63dd543.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<h3 id="i-get-tired-of-trying-udemy-and-coursera-late-september-2018">I get tired of trying Udemy and Coursera (late September 2018)</h3>
<p>After learning about online learning from PyQ, I decided to work on Udemy and Coursera.
I was planning to deepen my understanding on these sites, but while I was working on it, I felt like wanting to participate in the competition and gain experience, so I interrupted the process.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/479928/f2a9ef82-6a59-7614-e005-e31b6813f96b.png" alt="image.png">
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/479928/9af6dfeb-17b3-21e9-6fdc-0710ad8b3e42.png" alt="image.png">
(Still in the middle,&hellip;)</p>
<h3 id="participating-in-the-first-competition-signate-late-september-2018-201811-20hweek">Participating in the first competition (SIGNATE) (late September 2018-2018/11 20h/Week)</h3>
<p>I participated in <a href="https://signate.jp/competitions/137">Student Cup 2018</a>, which was being done at SIGNATE, not Kaggle.
In general, SIGNATE does not publish Kernel, and you have to write the code from scratch.
However, it was a great help for me because there was someone who released the baseline in this competition and I was able to work on it while studying what the code was doing.
Personally, in such cases, there is no language barrier and it is recommended to start the competition with SIGNATE.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/479928/9b18a05c-9432-b9a9-833f-e56a821ca53f.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Looking back, I think that one of the shortcuts is to participate in the competition before studying until you are satisfied.
Once you participate in the competition, you will be able to acquire new knowledge by practicing because you want to improve your score somehow. I feel that this is a very important point, and more recently, I want to acquire this kind of knowledge, so I am taking the stance of going to this competition.
As a result, I was able to get into the higher ranks, and it was a great harvest that it was fun to participate in the competition.</p>
<h3 id="buy-a-desktop-pc-late-october-2018">Buy a desktop PC (late October 2018)</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally into machine learning, so I&rsquo;ve decided to prepare a GPU and start learning.
So I wanted a desktop PC, but I was quite worried about how much I would invest.
I had the belief that I would buy the best thing I could buy at that time, so I made it about 170,000 yen.
At the time, I remember thinking that I had refused to leave because it was a huge expense: sweat_smile:</p>
<p>However, looking back now, I think that it was a very good decision because I was able to earn many times as much money as the investment with my internship and prize money.
We will continue to do our best to invest as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="participate-in-the-after-event-of-the-competition-mid-201812">Participate in the after event of the competition (Mid 2018/12)</h3>
<p>Fortunately, there was an after-event at the Student Cup after the competition.
By participating in this event, it became clear what was the difference with the higher ranks, and most of all, I was able to give advice by talking directly.
Also, at that time, there was no one around me studying machine learning, so I was able to increase my motivation by talking about technology.</p>
<h3 id="read-the-technical-book-from-one-side-201810-to-201812-dozens-of-books">Read the technical book from one side (2018/10 to 2018/12, dozens of books)</h3>
<p>Fortunately, there were so many books on machine learning in the university library that I borrowed them and read them.
At that time, it seemed like I was transcribing the source code that I wrote without much knowledge, but I was able to gain the knowledge that there are such libraries and frameworks for such processing, and Kaggle. I think I&rsquo;ve been relieved when reading the Kernel.
At that time, I think that there were almost no technical books such as this for Kaggle, but now <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B07YTDBC3Z/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">[Technology of data analysis to win with Kaggle]</a> is overwhelmingly recommended.
Also, &ldquo;[Theory and Practice by Python Machine Learning Programming Master Data Scientist]]&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%EF%BC%BB%E7%AC%AC2%E7%89%88%EF">https://www.amazon.co.jp/%EF%BC%BB%E7%AC%AC2%E7%89%88%EF</a> %BC%BDPython%E6%A9%9F%E6%A2%B0%E5%AD%A6%E7%BF%92%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83 %A9%E3%83%9F%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0-%E9%81%94%E4%BA%BA%E3%83%87%E3%83%BC%E3%82% BF%E3%82%B5%E3%82%A4%E3%82%A8%E3%83%B3%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88% E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8B%E7%90%86%E8%AB%96%E3%81%A8%E5%AE%9F%E8%B7%B5-impress- top-gear%E3%82%B7%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA-ebook/dp/B07BF5QZ41/ref=sr_1_4?__mk_ja_JP=%E3%82%AB%E3%82 %BF%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A&amp;keywords=%E6%A9%9F%E6%A2%B0%E5%AD%A6%E7%BF%92&amp;qid=1575727224&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-4) Was very good because I could learn all the different methods.</p>
<p>From first participation to #Kaggle until taking solo silver (25/1/Late 2019/2-2018/2)
Of course, I also debuted Kaggle as Titanic, but I saw a little Kernel and ended up moving it lol
After all, I think it&rsquo;s better to participate in a competition where the leaderboard changes in real time.
Therefore, I decided to participate in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation">Elo Merchant Category Recommendation</a> that was just held during the spring break.</p>
<p>This competition is about credit card information, and since it was a financial system that I was originally interested in, I became more motivated.
If you&rsquo;ve tried Titanic for the time being, but you&rsquo;re not sure what to do next, you can enjoy it by <strong>attending a competition about your area of interest</strong>.</p>
<p>Since this competition was a table data competition, I was able to utilize what I learned at the Student Cup.
It&rsquo;s a standard thing to try new competitions using the knowledge of the competitions that I participated in before, so I feel that it is very important to participate in as many competitions as time allows, so that you can quickly improve your level. I will.</p>
<p>Also, in the article I read at the time, there was an advice that you can get a silver medal if you follow the discussion firmly during the competition and implement it.
When I put it into practice in this competition, I was really happy that I got a silver medal.</p>
<p>Until becoming #Kaggle Master (25h/Week from late April 2018 to June 2018)
At the end of spring break, I became interested in natural language processing.The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification">Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification</a>, which was held at that timing, could touch the latest technology. I thought it was perfect, so I decided to participate fully.</p>
<p>At this stage, I didn&rsquo;t participate in the competition at Keras or PyTorch and I didn&rsquo;t know anything about it, so I decided to try to deepen my understanding not only by reading **Discussion but also by posting. **
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/479928/c2a5095e-eaa4-c07a-bba0-d28e6eda27e4.png" alt="image.png">
In this way, if there are other people who are interested in the contents, they will get an upvote and can get a medal.
In Kaggle, medals often refer to competition medals, but I think it would be quite amazing to be able to take the title of Master with Kernel or Discussion medals.</p>
<p>Before posting, I was a bit worried about speaking in English, but when other users gave me feedback and helped, I found Kaggle to be a really good community.
Since then, I have come to want to answer questions and contribute as much as possible.</p>
<p>In this way, by deepening my understanding and implementing some of my original ideas, I was able to reach the 20th place on the leaderboard and team up with people who were close.
I think that the team&rsquo;s efforts are very much learned, and there is a lot of fun that cannot be enjoyed as a solo. (It&rsquo;s a good memory to choose the final submission while talking all night on the last day.)</p>
<p>As a result, I was able to win the yearning gold medal and had a very good experience.
I feel that the key to this is that I tried to do something that I had never done.</p>
<p>Specifically, we tried the following:
**1. Created topics in the discussion so that you can efficiently obtain the information you want. **
**2. I formed a team and gained motivation while getting ideas that I couldn&rsquo;t think of myself. **
<strong>3. I researched related papers on arXiv and implemented the idea. (I feel that it is important to work within the range that can be done.)</strong>
**4. I tried to read not only the discussion but also all the Kernel comments that are getting attention. **
**5. I learned how to use it in GCP, and later wrote <a href="https://qiita.com/hiromu166/items/2a738f7be49d88d8b599">Article</a>. **</p>
<p>I was very grateful for such an encounter because I met a friend who could talk about Kaggle and participated in a reading session in another laboratory as the background that I worked so hard.</p>
<p>After that, I was able to win a silver medal and become a Kaggle Master.</p>
<p>#afterwards
Even if I went to the hospital, I wanted to know my evaluation at the moment, so I interviewed several companies.
At that time, I got a good reaction by telling me that I was a Kaggle Master, and sometimes I could treat it as a graduate.
I haven&rsquo;t belonged to the laboratory yet and have no track record of research, but I&rsquo;m glad I worked on it because I can introduce Kaggle as a track record.</p>
<p>Also, when I started to study programming, I was assigned a freelance job that I had never expected, and I have gained valuable experience.</p>
<p>So, from now on, I would like to make further efforts to meet that expectation.</p>
<p>#bonus
<strong>For those who want to start Kaggle now</strong></p>
<h3 id="there-are-so-many-things-you-can-get-from-twitter">There are so many things you can get from Twitter</h3>
<p>Personally, creating an account for machine learning on Twitter is very useful for collecting information.
I also highly recommend it because you can increase your motivation by watching the activities of strong people.
Also, when I participated in Kaggle Days Tokyo, many people knew on Twitter, so I enjoyed it very much.</p>
