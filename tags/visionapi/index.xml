      <description>This article is the 12th day article of [Fujitsu Systems Web Technology Advent Calendar](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/fsweb).  (Promise) The content of this article is my own opinion, not representative of the organization to which it belongs.
#Introduction This article summarizes the minimum procedure for using Google&amp;rsquo;s image recognition API &amp;ldquo;Cloud Vision API&amp;rdquo;. Lastly, I am trying to judge food photos.
Aside My personal hobby is Mesitello 1, and I post food photos on the LINE timeline to make me think &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m hungry&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>#Background  How are AWS certified measures taken? AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solution Architect â€“ Associates have a copy of the test book and a practice test, making it an easy environment for studying the test.

Difference between Udemy and Whizlabs I thought it would be better to do a lot of mock exams, so I tried English mock exams at Udemy and Whizlabs.</description>
