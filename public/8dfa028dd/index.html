<pre><code>#Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>This article was posted as the sixth day of <a href="https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/cisco">Cisco Advent Calendar 2019</a> by Cisco Systems LLC.</p>
<p>Seven years have passed since the SuperVision team at the University of Toronto, Canada won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2012 in 2012. At this time, by using a model using deep learning, modeling in machine learning and deep learning is often done in the third AI boom, and it is common sense nowadays to use machine learning/deep learning for AI. Has become.</p>
<p>However, according to a Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications questionnaire released in 2017, only 14.1% of the companies actually introduced AI solutions, and 22.8% of the companies are considering introducing AI solutions. The number of large companies is 36.9%, including the examination stage.
(Quoted: <a href="http://www.soumu.go.jp/johotsusintokei/whitepaper/ja/h30/html/nd132210.html">AI/IoT implementation status and schedule</a>MinistryofInternalAffairsandCommunications)</p>
<p>There are many open source services related to machine learning, and it is easy to use on a small scale. In the meantime, over the past two years, I&rsquo;ve written an article that makes using machine learning easy.
<a href="https://qiita.com/kmasuyam/items/8aaf54f08ae87f5646ce">2017 article: Machine learning of location information obtained using API</a>
<a href="https://qiita.com/kmasuyam/items/7a1c020c9c600a4eeae3">2018 article: Collecting machine learning teacher data using collaboration tools</a></p>
<p>So, this time, I would like to introduce an example in which modeling of machine learning can be easily performed using time series data that will be acquired most as data. Among them, we will focus on how machine learning is applied in the field of anomaly detection.</p>
<h1 id="data-in-chronological-order">Data in chronological order</h1>
<p>Time-series data refers to all data observed over time. And the order in which they are observed has meaning. When it comes to time series data related to Cisco products, Syslog data is also included in the time series data, and <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/ja_jp/products/security/stealthwatch/index">Stealthwatch</a>.html)Flowdata,<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/ja_jp/products/security/cloudlock/index.html">Cloudlock</a> connection destination data, and so on.</p>
<p>When applying time series data to machine learning and deep learning, the following flow is often taken.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/214710/a852f07b-de89-5764-14af-0d9b91b5fede.png" alt="4.png">
In the method based on the degree of similarity, how to extract the feature amount, setting the window size of the time series data (how to divide the time series set where the feature amount is likely to appear), and how to use the model in the later machine learning method The accuracy will vary greatly depending on the selection.</p>
<p>In the model-based method, first, the method used for the time series analysis is made to correspond. The methods used for quantitative time series analysis here include Hidden Markov Models, ARMA Models, VAR Models, SARIMA Models, and so on. A model that represents data transitions by regarding state transitions as changes in time series. Since these methods have parameters in each model, the obtained parameters are applied to the machine learning method.</p>

<p>This time, the goal is to &ldquo;compare normal data and find abnormal data&rdquo; for the time series data obtained as numerical data.</p>
<h1 id="anomaly-detection">Anomaly detection</h1>
<p>I recognize that anomaly detection is a very difficult field in which mathematical expressions are lined up, such as statistics, probability theory, and optimization theory, but there are so many fields that can be applied.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discovery of abnormal signs at the factory</li>
<li>Discovery of problems such as Malware in the security field</li>
<li>Discover anomalies related to health using anthropometric data
Various fields are possible. By being able to detect anomalies in these fields, there are advantages such as being able to deal with problems faster than humans can detect problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the field of anomaly detection, many machine learning methods have been proposed for application, but here we will introduce some of them.</p>
<p>I personally recognize that there are two important points in the anomaly detection field. It is an idea that attaches importance to accuracy (especially the idea of reducing False-Negative) and an idea that attaches importance to the speed of detection. This is an important idea because it is related to how the actual operation is performed.</p>
<h3 id="1-concept-that-attaches-great-importance-to-the-accuracy-of-abnormality-detection">1. Concept that attaches great importance to the accuracy of abnormality detection</h3>
<p>The idea that accuracy is important is often found in the field of failure detection. This is because I want to avoid &ldquo;`&rdquo; it is really broken, but there is a prediction &ldquo;not broken&rdquo;.
In machine learning terms, the idea is to increase recall.</p>
<p>(Reference) What is recall?
When considering accuracy, consider the following mixing matrix.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/214710/93f705ac-08f9-d33b-ff91-4aaff057d7f2.png" alt="5.png">
Figure 3: Mixing matrix</p>
<p>And ``recall rate&rsquo;&rsquo; is the accuracy expressed by the following formula.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/214710/6c0f5ce1-4192-6f84-6e8e-159a27dcc78f.png" alt="6.png">
In other words, recall is a measure of how much the model can be judged as abnormal when it is actually abnormal.</p>
<p>In reality, it is difficult to operate without humans to judge whether equipment such as factories is out of order. However, if the number of False-Negative is large, it is expected that the operation will not change before and after the introduction because the trust in the AI application is low and the burden on the administrator will not be reduced.
To avoid this situation, AI applications that reduce the number of False-Negatives and reduce the burden of fault detection are expected.</p>
<h3 id="2-concept-that-attaches-importance-to-the-speed-of-detection">2. Concept that attaches importance to the speed of detection</h3>
<p>When using machine learning/deep learning, you must also consider the calculation cost. No matter how accurate the model is, if it takes a long time to detect it, it makes no sense to introduce an AI application.</p>
<p>An example of this is a security AI application. No matter how much anomalous traffic is detected, if it is detected the next day, it makes no sense after the sensitive information has already been stolen.
In other words, unless the large amount of money can be invested in a server or other infrastructure, it is necessary to consider the calculation cost of the model and attach importance to the speed of detection.</p>
<p>Machine learning methods with low computational cost include naive Bayes classifiers and k-means/k-medoids methods. I won&rsquo;t explain the detailed method here, but there are many other methods used for anomaly detection.</p>
<h1 id="application-example">Application example</h1>
<p>Here I would like to consider an application example. The data used is assumed to be two-dimensional time series data such as the Stealthwatch Flow number. The data is assumed because we want to generalize it as much as possible.
<img width="1427" alt="Screenshots 2019-12-06 18.31.42.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/214710/de5ca695-5dc0-98f5-87ea-f1fc0f72e352.png">
Figure 4: Cisco Stealthwatch time series data</p>
<p>From the above time-series data, window size data is extracted as a pattern and compared with the normal pattern.</p>
<p>First of all, regarding pattern extraction, it is necessary to consider this time that the number of Flows is rarely 0, and that traffic is always flowing especially at the window size of minutes to hours. is.
If you know that the number will be 0, you can separate it at the time when the number becomes 0, but if it is not 0, you need to consider extracting the pattern.</p>
<p>When the window size is small, it is expected that the time zone and time width in which the same pattern appears will vary depending on the situation. For example, it is known that employees watch YouTube during lunch breaks, so even if it is known that the Flow number sharply rises from 12:00 to 13:00 and exceeds 13:00, it is considered that the maximum time differs depending on the day. (I don&rsquo;t know if it will have a maximum at 12:31 or a maximum at 12:36).</p>
<p>In this way, Dynamic Time Warping-DTW is a method to calculate the degree of similarity when the shapes are similar regardless of the time width. With this method, it is possible to judge even if the data length is not uniform. In other words, it is possible to judge even when the time width is different.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when the deviation with respect to the time axis is considered to be significant, the Euclidean distance is used. For example, the difference in the number of Flows during the day and at night when the window size is large.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s actually implement DTW in Python. Dynamic programming is used to implement DTW.
In addition, when measuring the distance between two points, it is considered that it may be measured in absolute value or in Euclidean distance, so it is separated by the argument of <code>method</code>.The first and second arguments represent two sets of time series data separated by window size. If you want to compare the time series data for several days, you will have to call this function multiple times.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>It is possible to classify into two, normal and abnormal, by performing the two-class classification above.
The details of the k-medoids method will be omitted here, but the features are not so different from the k-means method, but unlike the k-means method, since the medoids are calculated and classified, they have the characteristic of being resistant to outliers. In addition, it is possible to classify as long as the distance matrix can be obtained, so the application is effective.
The method for obtaining a medoid is as follows.</p>

<h1 id="finally">Finally</h1>
<p>This time, I wrote about anomaly detection methods and application methods. Then, a code example for detecting anomalies using 2D time series data was shown.</p>
<p>With the k-medoids method, classification can be performed by determining the distance, even if it is a character string, because classification can be performed only by determining the distance matrix. Since the character string distance uses the Jaro-Winkler distance and the Levenshtein distance, please also search for it.</p>
<p>I hope you will try this article and try out anomaly detection using the data you have.</p>
