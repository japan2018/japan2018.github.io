      <description>In this post, I will introduce the management method and contents of the reading event held by the &amp;quot;AI Product Development Team&amp;quot; that I lead.  The books targeted at this reading party are ** [INSPIRED Product management that creates enthusiastic products] ** https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0814STTHV/
is.
In Japanese, it is translated as &amp;ldquo;Product Management that creates enthusiasm products,&amp;rdquo; but in English How to Create Tech Products Customers Love is.
How to make a loved product.</description>

      <description>#1.First of all  This time, I will briefly summarize the softmax function.
#2. What is the softmax function? Convert the output of the neural network into a total probability of 1. ![Screenshot 2020-03-28 16.31.12.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/209705/1297a7fb-d2fc-4cee-babe-(4ff1aa6198bb.png)
#3.Specific calculation If the output $y_1$-$y_3$ is as follows,
The result of passing the softmax function is ![Screenshot 2020-03-28 16.25.28.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/209705/d8bbcd6a-8a78-86f6-ba13-(16bc42ec5b12.png)
#4. Code
import numpy as np def softmax(z): y = np.exp(z) / np.sum(np.exp(z)) return y z = np.</description>

      <description>Deep learning with #C# (matrix calculation)  This time, I created only the program that calculates the matrix necessary for deep learning. The book I referred to is &amp;ldquo;Making Deep Learning (O&amp;rsquo;Reilly)&amp;rdquo; from scratch. This book is very easy to understand and I think it is a good book, so I recommend it. It&amp;rsquo;s not a manga, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop&amp;hellip;I was so interested. Since I have only read about half of it, there are many things I do not understand well, but this time, I made a matrix calculation program in C#.</description>

      <description>[Previous previous article: 1st month](https://qiita.com/Lulu_die_Zweite/items/8e5cb713073982353ac3)  Previous article: Second month
Third month By the second month I&amp;rsquo;ve faced quite a few problems. There seems to be a limit to maximizing the prediction accuracy of one AI. Therefore, I came up with a method that may improve the prediction accuracy, so I will write it here.
##AI majority theory The method is simple, first create some good AI, preferably an odd number of AIs.</description>
