      <description># In a nutshell  Purchase a cheap gaming PC (Windows), Enable to switch CPU/GPU in virtual environment of Anaconda, Tensorflow-Running the GPU (v2.0) code, With 4 patterns including CPU/GPU of Colaboratory, I compared the performance. I will summarize the performance comparison results and the Windows version environment construction procedure. Article.
*I often hear that GPU is effective for machine learning

      <description>#Environment  ・Ubuntu 16.04 ・Python 3.7.3 ・Pytorch 1.2.0
GPU cannot be used with #pytorch
I thought about deeplearning, but it&amp;rsquo;s slow so check if you can see cuda in ipython.
In [1]: import torch In [2]: torch.cuda.is_available() Out[2]: False why? As a possible cause, I thought that NVIDIA-driver is not working,

About Google colab GPU gacha I think it&amp;rsquo;s well known that you have a GPU gacha. See below for details. https://qiita.com/koshian2/items/d33edc963ed6cfcad77e
Trigger I thought that it was faster than usual, and when I checked the GPU, P100 was added as follows. GPU speed comparison Immediately, I compared the training speed.</description>
