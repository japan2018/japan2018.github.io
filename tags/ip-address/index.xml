      <description>I was writing because I was thinking of scraping with python,  If the same IP address is accessed for a certain period of time, the access will be denied for a while. When a site like this appears, it may not be possible to scrape well, so I will try to impersonate the IP address and scrape.
However, since the operation is confirmed only for macOS, I think that the method is a little different especially for windows.</description>
