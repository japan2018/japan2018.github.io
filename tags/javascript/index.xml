On the other hand, Professor Zenji Hanyu** &amp;ldquo;** Things like entertaining shogi are difficult for AI**,&amp;rdquo; he said.
Then, what kind of point is difficult when actually trying to make entertainment AI, What level of &amp;ldquo;entertainment&amp;rdquo; can we do?
This is a development diary record of the difficult challenge of &amp;ldquo;entertainment shogi&amp;rdquo;. It is a story up to the idea of the entertainment AI obtained.</description>

Using the simple principle of contact between balls, In an article that introduced how the number of people infected with the virus will increase and decrease, I think it was very easy to understand.</description>

      <description>As a hobby, I personally developed a web service that AI automatically marks the readability of characters when I write them in a browser, and released it about 2 weeks ago: relaxed:  []((https://letters.choo.works/) Letters-AI handwriting scoring app
The core technology is front-end implementation with DeepLearning image recognition and Preact. In this article, we will describe Service outline, technical details, and impressions regarding the developed application.
Service overview Function introduction Since it has a small number of pages and is lightweight, it is probably faster to see the application regarding the function, but I will explain the function including an overview of the technology used with screenshots.</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Introduction&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;  First of all, the target audience for this article is &amp;ldquo;non-engineers&amp;rdquo;.
As a non-engineer, I am aiming to acquire programming skills and explain what I did in the process.
By the way, I am not studying as a programmer now, and I am still studying, and since I was writing an article in the course of studying in the first place, the teacher who was suddenly made an adviser of the Kabaddi club decided the rules of the sport.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  I wrote Things like this before, but as an artisan, I was tempted to make my own tools.
 https://github.com/Kray-G/kinx  Looks like JavaScript, feels like Ruby, and it is the script language fitting in C programmers.    Well, even if you say no, it&amp;rsquo;s something you can find somewhere (I won&amp;rsquo;t say it here), but I&amp;rsquo;m lonely even if I&amp;rsquo;m self-satisfied, so let&amp;rsquo;s leave a footstep for commentary.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Many data structures provide destructive operations. Arrays, for example, offer the ability to update one element with another. The processing time of the array update operation is excellent in that it does not depend on the length or value of the array. On the other hand, there are times when you want to perform non-destructive operations on data structures. For example, in each calculation of reduce/fold processing (convolution operation) that uses an array as a cumulative value, a new array should be generated nondestructively (it is possible to use the array after destruction as the calculation result, but Is hard to say).</description>

      <description>Ubiregi Advent Calendar 2019 On the 4th day, we will introduce easy IoT using Razpai and MESH.  What to make We make a very simple thing: pressing a &amp;ldquo;button&amp;rdquo; on the MESH block will post a fixed message to Slack. As an application, I attach a monitor to Raspberry Pi and use it as an intercom. I think that I would like to see it. While living alone, there is a problem that I do not know if people are visiting while I am away, so if I put a MESH button instead, it seems like I can notify the smartphone that a person came.</description>

I like the &amp;ldquo;likes&amp;rdquo; of all posts on my page, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know the View and Stock of each post or the total. Since I have about 20 posts, I decided to try various methods to get all of my posts, views, likes, and stocks for studying.
When I looked it up, everyone hit the Qiita API in various ways to obtain information, and there are many reference pages, so I will carry out it while checking them.</description>

Everyone told me a lot, but it was an overwhelming victory for the &amp;ldquo;command pattern main loop function (1500 lines)&amp;rdquo; I wrote. Why did you write such a code?
So, today, I will discover the &amp;ldquo;most world-wide function&amp;rdquo; from github to heal my injured pride. In other words, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to see a yaw function rather than the one I wrote.</description>
