      <description>This article is the 12/20 article of [Sumzap Advent Calendar 2019 #1](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/sumzap1).  What is # Airtest
https://airtest.netease.com/ Cross platform UI automation IDE developed and published by NetEase. Here we will refer to the generic name of IDEs and projects for automated testing of mobile applications that use image recognition.
