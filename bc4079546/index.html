<h3 id="japanese-situation">・Japanese situation</h3>
<p>First, the general situation
If you draw it on a linear scale, as shown below, there is a large value at the left end of the bar graph of the number of new infections, but this contains the total value of data before March 25.
So, this time, I will analyze the second wave of infection that started on March 26.
Looking at the graph below, we can see that the number of infections (hospitalization) is declining just before 10,000 people.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/233744/433e7126-e214-5956-7bed-2b2d3d5a1763.png" alt="original_data_total_502linear.png">
Below is a semi-log graph other than the bar graph.

Solving this with the above differential equation gives:
However, keep in mind that there are input parameter dependencies and the results you get will be different.
Here, the number of new infections is shown as an example.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/233744/30c93bad-c575-7fa4-ac4e-048195cfb468.png" alt="SIHR_total_f1=1f2=1s0=21735.png">

That is,</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">Basic reproduction number = 4.18\\
Effective number of reproductions = 0.21\\
Infection rate \gamma (R-1)＝－3.49e^{-2}
</code></pre><p>Was obtained.
Please note that this value depends on the parameters when fitting.
In conclusion, the peak number of new infections has passed, and it seems that the number of new infections has just peaked and will decrease thereafter. Then, the number of infections and the number of cures intersect in about 12 days, and the number of infections (hospitalization) will reach about half in about 3 weeks.
However, depending on the situation, the number of infections may remain gradual without decreasing, so it can be said that extending the national emergency declaration is an unavoidable decision.
It is difficult to know how to reach the end surely, but if various fittings are performed and the number of infections and the number of cures can be crossed as they are, it can be said that the situation does not return as the second wave and it can be alleviated.
However, depending on the area, each decision will be made, and it is necessary to continue the current lifestyle.</p>
<h3 id="status-of-tokyo">・Status of Tokyo</h3>
<p>The general conditions are as follows, and 165 people and 160 people on the right are disappointed. The whole thing seems to happen randomly because of this. But that may be true&hellip;
In addition, it seems that the number of healings has a step in the middle and the data is not managed.
*The number of cures is one of the most important data that is directly linked to medical collapse.

However, the number of infections, the number of cures, and the number of deaths have some regularity, so I will try fitting them.

<p>Hokkaido was one of the cities where the spread of infection just started last time.
Just looking at the following overview, you can see that it is still in a difficult situation.

And the fitting result is as follows.
In the calculation, the number of new infections is around the peak, and the result is becoming saturated.

<p>Kanagawa prefecture, like Hokkaido, seems to have passed the peak number of new infections, but it is still around the peak number of infections.
It&rsquo;s a situation where we can&rsquo;t predict. The rate of decrease in the number of new infections is extremely small, and the increase in the number of cures is yet to come.

As shown below, Ishikawa is more common overall, but the behavior is similar.
And, it seems that Ishikawa has reached the peak of the number of new infections after passing the peak of new infections, but Toyama has a small amount, but it is difficult to determine whether it has peaked out because the daily amount is continuing. By the way.

Toyama is very difficult to fit, so please use the following as reference information only.
The number of effective reproductions is a little larger.</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">Basic reproduction number = 5.36\\
Effective reproduction number = 0.81\\
Infection rate \gamma (R-1)＝－9.30e^{-3}

<p>The number of new infections in each of these prefectures has recently dropped to 5 or less.
Looking at the graph, the number of infections has started to decrease in Kyoto where the number of cures has increased, but in other prefectures the number of cures is still small and the increase in the number of cures is waiting for the number of infections to decrease. ..
However, the number of cures will surely increase in the future, and it is expected to end.

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>・Using the SIHR model, I tried to find the number of effective reproductions in various parts of Japan
・For Japan as a whole, the number of infections is beginning to decline, and it has come to an end.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, Tokyo and Osaka are on the verge of dying, and it is an urgent task to make them end. Both need more cures.
・Hokkaido is still around the peak of new infections, and the situation is unpredictable. The second challenge is to bring it to an end・In other areas, the number of new infections has been on a declining trend, and it is considered that the number of new infections is near the peak of the number of infections or has started to decline. However, it can be seen that the regions covered this time are in an unpredictable situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>・Since the obtained quantities depend on input parameters, it is necessary to show the accuracy of the obtained quantities.</p>
