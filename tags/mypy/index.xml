      <description>I had been writing TypeScript for about a year, but I started to work on Python3 for about a month.  Although Python is simple and fun, there are places that I inherited from other people, and it is hard to develop and have no type.
The hardest part is reading the code, and what does this function return? Do not know at first glance what this variable contains. &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;There is no type as a document.</description>
