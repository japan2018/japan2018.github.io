      <description>This article is the 13th day of [JSL \ (Japan System Giken \) Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/jsl).   Recently, I felt that there was a timing when internal WiFi became slower, but I could not quantitatively know how slow it was, so I wrote a script that periodically executes a speed test.
First summary  I wrote a program in Python to measure the speed of in-house WiFi using Speedtest CLI - Internet connection measurement for developers It is convenient to be able to execute speed test from CUI  Speed test from CUI First of all, I thought about running a speed test with CUI because I wanted to run it regularly with cron etc.</description>
