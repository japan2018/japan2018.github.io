      <description>#Random variables and dice  First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s consider an example of 1 to 6 dice: game_die: which has no distortion.
The dice rolls from 1 to 6 are equally likely (there is no bias in their appearance), so the appearance of each die can be given with the following probabilities.
$ P (probability of getting 1) = \frac{1}{6}\qquad P (probability of getting 2) = \frac{1}{6}\qquad P (probability of getting 3) = \frac{1}{6}\</description>

      <description>#Introduction  When classifying by machine learning, it is sometimes desirable to obtain the probability of belonging to those classes as well as the classification result. When the number of data for positive cases is extremely small compared to the number of data for negative cases (such data is called imbalanced data), if the prediction model is constructed using all of those data, the prediction result will also be negative. Often, it tends to be difficult to accurately classify positive data.</description>
