      <description>#Introduction  It&amp;rsquo;s been a month since I started studying deep learning.
I thought I could understand the basics, so I wondered if I could do something.
Then, suddenly, I came up with an estimate of the ranking of this boat race.
I was not convinced that I could predict the rank, but I knew that open source of boat race data was open to the public, so I thought I had to try this.</description>

      <description>This article is the 18th day article of [NTT Communications Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/nttcom).  Yesterday was @yusuke84&amp;rsquo;s article, Thinking about WebRTC Platform SkyWay support. **Merry Christmas! **:santa::christmas_tree::gift::santa::christmas_tree::gift::santa::christmas_tree::gift::santa::christmas_tree::gift::santa::christmas_tree::gift::santa: :christmas_tree::gift:
#Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s the company&amp;rsquo;s Advent Calendar, so let&amp;rsquo;s write some technical tips at the beginning to keep up with the flow! So, I was searching for information about Neural Network, but in the end, I settled on a story that I was interested in, which was more theoretical than implementation, and this article is the end of it.</description>
