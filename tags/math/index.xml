      <description>Recently, I often talk about talk about wanting to automatically determine the threshold, so I summarized it.  Threshold design corresponds to two-dimensional unsupervised clustering of two groups. Yes. This time, we will summarize 5 classical and useful methods, taking image binarization as an example.
Note: If the distribution system is unknown, there is no correct answer for threshold determination
Preparation This time I will use this photo taken properly. The brightness histogram of this image is as follows.</description>

      <description># What are you saying  Please read this article first (https://qiita.com/MirrgieRiana/items/da7dade622770a04d8f7).
In this article, I will implement the &amp;ldquo;algorithm for determining whether the world is inconsistent when given a political party name&amp;rdquo; in Python, which was asked in the original article.
Formulate mathematically If NHK is 0 and the people are 1, the “party protecting the people from NHK” can be expressed as the “party protecting 0 to 1”.</description>

      <description>The length with the direction can be expressed by a vector. Clifford algebra makes it possible to handle areas and volumes by combining vectors. We introduce a Pauli matrix as a three-dimensional Clifford algebra representation matrix and confirm that it is isomorphic to a biquaternion. The calculation by SymPy is attached.  This is a series article.
