      <description>## Introduction  I often use FastAPI recently, and I wanted to quickly build it with Docker and dispose of it. As a memo, I&amp;rsquo;d like to leave a lightweight construction method.
Preparation  Environment that can use Docker and Docker Compose  $ docker --version Docker version 19.03.8, build afacb8b7f0  The file structure looks like this  . ├── Dockerfile ├── docker-compose.yml ├── main.py └── requirements.txt Source You can clone from here https://github.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  The world of deep learning, especially Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), has grown dramatically in recent years, and I think that research is progressing in various fields such as text-to-image, voice conversion, and sound source separation.
In this talk, I will loosely write about wav2pix, which generates face images from voice.
Paper: WAV2PIX: SPEECH-CONDITIONED FACE GENERATION USING GENERATIVEADVERSARIAL NETWORKS
#Overview https://imatge-upc.github.io/wav2pix/
The proposed model consists of the following three modules.</description>

The original article was written a long time ago (a year or so?), but now that I have enough knowledge, I thought I could make it a little better, so I decided to try it!
I will not talk about installing Docker in detail, so if you are interested, please check the original article! (Here)willhelp.)
Also, as a clear difference from the previous article, Django thinks as an API delivery server and assumes Vue.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  A layer corresponding to each runtime version can be created with the docker-lambda build image!
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/var/task lambci/lambda:build-python3.8 \ &amp;gt; pip install -r requirements.txt -t python/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ Software packages that you want to run on AWS Lambda can be layered with yumda!
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/git-layer:/lambda/opt lambci/yumda:2 yum install -y &amp;lt;package&amp;gt; Preparing the environment from scratch is quite difficult A common caveat with AWS Lambda and Lambda Layers is the handling of native binaries.</description>

Now that the development of Pipenv is not very active, I think that there will be occasions when Poetry is used in projects using Python. So I&amp;rsquo;ll try to summarize the development flow using Poetry again.

1. Introduction I remade the MobileNet V2-SSD Lite training environment construction article that I wrote about a year ago into an ultra-simple specification. If you start work from the stage where the latest Docker for GPU is introduced, I think you can start training in about 15 minutes. I think there are almost no mistakes. After learning, I plan to do Integer Quantization of the trained model (.</description>

#Introduction
Team development&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to build an environment&amp;hellip; At that time, use Docker (miscellaneous).
This article is a repost of what I gave to qrunchLet&amp;rsquo;s build a Django/postgreSQL/gunicorn/nginx development environment using Docker and Docker-compose, which are very convenient for team development! !
The whole flow is based on almost the following sites, but I intend to make the article easy to understand, such as putting comments in almost all lines of the configuration file etc.</description>

      <description>There was a person in charge of specialized infrastructure related things in the company, and he was kind to the environment, but it would be bad if I had to study Docker around myself as soon as possible. I&#39;ve finally been introduced to Docker recently, so I&#39;ll try to put together and try what I have learned as a memorandum.  Since I have been working on unfamiliar work such as infrastructure around my career, please forgive me for things that are rough (shallow) in terms of knowledge.</description>

You can easily create a Web service with your needs by automatically synchronizing the database of Web services in the world and adding added value that the original family does not have.
For example, scrape the data of the EC site and keep it as a database yourself, provide a search method that does not exist in the original home, attach a link, and have a lightweight business model like earning by affiliate at the level of individual business Is possible.</description>

Greatness of this extension VS Code&amp;rsquo;s extension function &amp;ldquo;Remote-Containers&amp;rdquo; is to launch VS Code in a container and communicate with VS Code of the host machine so that you can perform in-container development as if you were developing in a local environment.</description>

But wait a minute! Are you able to benefit from the Python ecosystem and develop properly?
By creating a good development environment, not only can the development be made more efficient by input interpolation and formatters , but also unexpected problems can be prevented by static analysis, ① Easy ② Explosion speed ③ You can write programs safely.</description>

The name of Git/GitHub/GitLab was at a level I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about, but the version control mentioned above is mandatory, and you will be using your own GitLab. Although I was an amateur, I immediately felt the convenience, and I thought that it would be better if I could establish GitLab after studying Docker on ESXi at home.</description>

      <description>I have created docker-compose in a form that can be used even for projects that have already been created, so I will summarize the specifications in an article.  ** Please see How to Use on GitHub → GitHub**
(I&amp;rsquo;m sorry if you change the DB from the default sqlite&amp;hellip;
The deployment environment is Django＋Nginx＋Gunicorn.
Overview Please refer to the README on GitHub for how to use the link provided above.</description>

      <description># &amp;lt;i class=&#39;fa fa-circle&#39;&amp;gt; Let&#39;s use nim  It looks like nim is fast It seems to be similar to Python, so let&amp;rsquo;s try it. There is no Jupyter kernel. I made it with docker.
How to execute To install docker, see Install Docker Engine.
If you execute the following, Jupyter will start.
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 tsutomu7/nim Open &amp;ldquo;docker host IP address:8888&amp;rdquo; in your browser. Select &amp;ldquo;nim&amp;rdquo; from &amp;ldquo;New&amp;rdquo; in the upper right.</description>
