      <description># Overview  I think it is very important to verify the effects after conducting various prototypes with WEB services, I think that basic statistics can be used enough as a method. This time, we summarized the method of statistical data analysis using Python+JupyterLab (Docker) for the purpose of basic statistics, verification of the effects of prototypes that can be used in business, and data analysis.
The notebook I used this time is also available below, so please refer to it.</description>

      <description># What we could achieve  Since we were able to build the following environment with Docker, we summarized the flow from Docker image build to JupyterLab startup.
 Easy Python version switching (Python3 â‡„ Python2) Easy startup of JupyterLab 1 Can be deleted as soon as the environment is no longer needed I want to easily build an environment on Mac and Windows  Actually built environment  macOS Catalina (MacBook Pro(15-inch, Late2016)) Windows 10  Docker image You need to login to get it.</description>

      <description>I usually do **data analysis and model construction** mainly on Jupyter.  I will make a note of how many times I will research it. (Updated from time to time)
Development I want to reload the modified .py module Modules that have already been imported will be cached, or will not be updated when imported normally. ** You can reload (reimport) with the following. **
import importlib importlib.reload(hoge) # hoge is an imported module I didn&amp;rsquo;t know this much until recently, and I restarted every time, so it&amp;rsquo;s really a scale.</description>

      <description>## [Content]   ** 2020/02/19 We reviewed some contents and confirmed the operation with Raspberry Pi 3 model B. ** ** Added Node-RED environment construction. **  Finally the Raspberry Pi 4 model B has started selling in Japan. In order to use it immediately, I rewrote the previously posted [Building Raspberry Pi for Python and machine learning study] to the Raspberry Pi 4th edition. In addition to the hardware, I have the latest version of Raspbian (Buster 20200213).</description>
