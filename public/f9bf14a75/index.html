<pre><code>## What is a data scientist?
</code></pre>
<p>As the subject of the title, let&rsquo;s think about the profession of being a data scientist, which is being said variously these days.
Even in the industry, the definition of this occupation is vague and there is no unified view.</p>
<p>Well, honestly, it&rsquo;s a story that &ldquo;a data scientist wants to give a name to a person who wants to give it a name&rdquo;, but since it&rsquo;s a big deal, I&rsquo;ll write my personal thoughts during this period.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those who usually think about data scientists, it may not have written anything new.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If anything, I would like people to read &ldquo;How can I be a data scientist?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I want to hire a trendy data scientist, but what kind of person should I hire?&rdquo; I would like to acknowledge</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="take-a-look-at-public-opinion">Take a look at public opinion</h2>
<p>――
For the time being, let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the famous myths of the famous definitions already in existence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>&ldquo;Data Scientist’ is a Data Analyst who lives in California&rdquo;</strong></em>
<em>A data analyst living in California is called a &ldquo;data scientist&rdquo;</em>
――
<em><strong>&ldquo;A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.&quot;</strong></em>
<em>A race that is better at statistics than engineers and better at engineering than statisticians</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>――
Both seem to say that they are good, and I feel that they have no children.</p>
<p>There is also such a famous figure</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>&ldquo;THE DATA SCIENCE VENN DIAGRAM&rdquo;</strong></em>
<a href="http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram">http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram</a>
：
I would like you to read the link above for details, but the point is that the data scientist has three hacking skills, math and statistics, and unique strengths.
：
*Here, &ldquo;unique strengths&rdquo; seem to be nuances (such as specific business knowledge).
：

</blockquote>
<p>――</p>
<p>Or, a professional association in Japan officially announces the skills required for data scientists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>** Data scientist definition, skill set, skill level **
<a href="http://www.datascientist.or.jp/news/2014/pdf/1210.pdf">http://www.datascientist.or.jp/news/2014/pdf/1210.pdf</a>
‥
The wording is slightly different, but it is very similar to the Ben diagram above.
‥
――

</blockquote>
<p>――</p>
<h2 id="i-want-a-clearer-more-structural-definition">I want a clearer, more structural definition</h2>
<p>I know the existing definitions above, but I feel that none of them are sufficient.
There are two reasons</p>
<p>** ① Not structural. **
It does not show the value chain of analytical work in the business, and it is difficult to understand in what aspect each skill is needed and how</p>
<p><strong>② The dualism that the skill is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;</strong>
Honestly, it&rsquo;s very difficult to get the three skills shown in the Venn diagram above at a comprehensive and perfect level.
Or, in the first place, I don&rsquo;t know at what level I should acquire.</p>
<p>In this article, I would like to structurally define the skillset of a data scientist in order to solve these two problems.
Especially regarding (2), after introducing the concept that there are two levels of skill, &ldquo;reading&rdquo; and &ldquo;writing&rdquo;, we would like to discuss the necessary skill set.</p>
<h2 id="data-scientist--multilingual-theory">Data Scientist = &ldquo;Multilingual&rdquo; theory</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wondered if the concept of a data scientist might be a bit closer to a &ldquo;multilingual translator.&rdquo; Data scientists must be able to manipulate different languages and translate between languages.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;language&rdquo; used here means</p>
<p>・Business language
・Number/KPI
・Statistics/mathematical formula
・Programming language</p>
<p>Etc. Please think and see.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Business owners and planning departments often speak in the business language and often cannot communicate in other languages.
&ldquo;Aim to increase sales Yo&rdquo; is not mentioned as a concrete formula or algorithm. ：
――
Although statisticians are good at dealing with difficult mathematical formulas, they are not good at talking like real business events. Even if you output a list of mathematical formulas and numbers, people of other occupations will not pay attention.
――
Engineers are not always strong in numbers.
――
Also, computers do not understand anything other than programming languages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if all players (except calculators) understand the importance of data analysis and data-driven, the situations described above are common.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking in the same Japanese so I can understand!&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think. Different positions have completely different words and meanings behind them.</p>
<p><strong>There is a &ldquo;data scientist&rdquo; to overcome this situation</strong>, which is the image of a data scientist I would like to discuss in this article.
You need to be able to move back and forth between different languages, be a translator when you need it, and be a handyman to jump through a series of value chains for data analysis.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-value-chain-and-reading-writing">Analysis value chain and &ldquo;reading&rdquo; &ldquo;writing&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The people involved in the value chain of the analysis process in business have the following structure. And this value chain will form a V-shaped flow by the reciprocating process of &ldquo;writing&rdquo; and &ldquo;reading&rdquo;. ** Let&rsquo;s explain one by one. **
――</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/68432/5847b7d2-1c96-b427-96ed-6108019f226a.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>First of all, most analysis processes start with words such as “our sales structure should be more visible Yo” of business managers (managers, product managers, business managers, etc.) Eventually, it will reach the computing resources through the people involved.
(However, it is not the case that each person is divided and shared, and it is quite possible that one person covers multiple areas.)</p>
<p>This is the <strong>writing process</strong>.</p>
<p>At a high level, at each step in the process:
The lines of each player are probably symbolized (and prejudiced), and I don&rsquo;t think each Kimiko usually makes all these words&hellip;</p>
<p>However, during my work, I&rsquo;m sure that I&rsquo;m talking about the language I wrote here (maybe the same Japanese, but if I don&rsquo;t understand the language properly, the conversation won&rsquo;t work).</p>
<p>[Insert figure]<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/68432/022aece3-5b85-20e7-c735-333f4a06bbb8.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Very strong skills are needed to go down this process.
In general, <strong>the process of &ldquo;writing&rdquo; is by far more difficult than &ldquo;reading&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Planning/Management person</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Business knowledge and logic must be mobilized to design meaningful, compelling and computable KPIs. It is also important that the content meets the expectations of business managers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Analytical/statistical person</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is necessary to consider concrete measures for how to analyze and quantify the KPI you want to see. It is necessary to scrutinize the usable data, determine the range of actually used data (excluding bad data, etc.), think about the granularity of observation, and design a statistical model if necessary. You must also consider what kind of chart the results will be displayed in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Engineer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Implement the calculation logic that the analyst thought of. It is necessary to pay attention to the processing speed by making a general-purpose design in consideration of changes in the range and granularity of data. In some cases, knowledge of statistical model packages is also required. It is also desirable that the output format is carefully considered and, if necessary, familiar with techniques such as visualization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Computing infrastructure</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depending on the amount of data, it may be necessary to have human resources with infrastructure engineer knowledge for tuning computing resources and parallelization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>――
Basically, it is almost impossible or almost impossible to ask all of these skills from one person.
Therefore, if a person who has a full stack of &ldquo;writing&rdquo; skills is defined as a &ldquo;data scientist,&rdquo; this occupation will be jammed ** in no time.</p>
<h2 id="difficulty-level-differs-between-writing-and-reading">Difficulty level differs between &ldquo;writing&rdquo; and &ldquo;reading&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s English or Lebanese, reading is easier than writing.
It is often problematic that reading English is strong but Writing and Speaking are not developed in Japanese language learning courses, but I think that it makes a lot of sense just by being able to read personally. , I think it would be nice to be able to listen as well)</p>
<p>Aside from that, the process of &ldquo;writing&rdquo;, that is, analyzing and reading the results of business processes is important and interesting.
If you write it the same way as before, it will look like the following.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/68432/aae264e4-04b5-3172-0f2a-a2610e269830.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>In this process, even if you do not have the ability to write, if you have the ability to read, you will be able to fully participate in the conversation, and you will be able to express your opinions and contribute.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to build a statistical model yourself, as long as you know the structure of the input data and how to read the model results.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if you design a KPI for half a person, you need to be able to understand the numerical value of each KPI and make a business interpretation and make a hypothesis.
‥
Even if you can&rsquo;t scratch the code yourself, it can be useful if you have the skill to repair and reuse part of a person&rsquo;s code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this is the case, the learning hurdle is significantly lower than with &ldquo;writing&rdquo;, but there are many scenes that are useful for business at this level.</p>
<h2 id="try-to-summarize-what-you-need">Try to summarize what you need</h2>
<p>I think it is like this when I summarize the discussions so far in a table.
If there are about two strengths in &ldquo;writing&rdquo; in this table and &ldquo;reading&rdquo; other than that, I think that it is sufficiently powerful as a person involved in the data analysis process **.</p>
<p>In other words, **If you want to name yourself, you can name yourself a data scientist, right? **I&rsquo;m saying that.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/68432/8e3569fc-8259-f90f-e1f5-72b5f8e49423.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>I would like to emphasize that
――
<strong>1. You don&rsquo;t have to &ldquo;write&rdquo; all fields</strong>
It would be nice if possible, but it is difficult in reality.In some cases, it may be more beneficial to further deepen the areas where you can already write, rather than trying to increase the coverage of writing.</p>
<p><strong>2. If you can read a language that you can&rsquo;t write (・∀・) ii!!</strong>
As I mentioned earlier, reading is easier than writing, whether in English or Lebanese.
And that may be sufficient, depending on the nature of your work.
The first thing is to be able to read/listen without going to Writing/Speaking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.
The point is that <strong>&ldquo;you will be able to participate in conversations in any language&rdquo;</strong>.
And if you&rsquo;re in a “language you can write in”, take the initiative to join the conversation.</p>
<h2 id="at-the-end">At the end</h2>
<p>I wrote it as icing, but what I want to say is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Despair that thinks that perfect quatro-lingual is impossible. But if it&rsquo;s bilingual + you can read and listen in two languages,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s pretty good, and still it&rsquo;s pretty good, so let&rsquo;s do our best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Ph.D, **Spark, Hadoop, SQL can of course be used **, not only analysis by Python but also the level of constructing the algorithm to be incorporated into the product **, statistical model and machine learning I hope that there is no such a silly job as a data scientist who has abundant knowledge **, sufficient business experience **, good team management, and high communication ** recruiting people.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
