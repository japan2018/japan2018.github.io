      <description>#Introduction  Hello My name is DNA1980. Recently GNN(Graph Neural Network) is popular. I also want to follow the flow and handle graphs, but there are many graph data in the world that I do not know well. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing when I classify&amp;hellip; Separately, I think that GNN can be applied if it can be dropped into a graph even if it does not have a graph structure from the beginning like a network, so I tried applying it to everyone&amp;rsquo;s favorite MNIST.</description>
