      <description>This is the 21st day article of [MYJLab Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/myjlab).Thatchwillbeincharge.(Sorryforthedelay)  This time what to do Recently, there is a phenomenon that there is a FamilyMart on the other side of the road across my road. In order to visualize this phenomenon, I would like to drop the increase in the number of FamilyMart stores in the time series heat map for each prefecture.
What to use There is a library called Leaflet that can draw nice maps with JavaScript.</description>
