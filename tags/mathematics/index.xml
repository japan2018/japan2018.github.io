      <description>I found an interesting problem, so I tried solving it.  Problem  There are $N$ cards, and the $i$th card has $A_i$ written on it. T picks out $M$ from this at the same time. How many pairs of numbers are there on the removed card? However, it does not distinguish pairs such as $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ whose order is changed. For example, consider the case where $N=5$, $M=2$, $\{A\}=\{1,2,2,3,4\}$.</description>

      <description>Recently, new pneumonia has become popular.  Since I had previously conducted a study using a mathematical model of infectious disease called SIR model, I applied it to a new model of pneumonia. Mathematical models can be used to predict the future of infectious diseases.
This time, we focus on Wuhan*** Hubei Province*** (provinces including Wuhan), which is the center of the outbreak, to model infectious diseases and predict the future of infectious diseases.</description>

      <description>Hello.  watawatavoltage. In this article, I would like to write about the world of control engineering books. This article is a type of article that is updated as needed, rather than being posted in the completed state. &amp;ldquo;Introduction&amp;rdquo; explains why we write such articles. If you write a book that you would like to introduce in the comment section, it will be reflected at any time. Thank you.

      <title>[Python] How to sample from any probability density function in Python</title>

      <description>~~MCMC should be done! Onegacious without the tsukkomi  As you know, many probability density functions are predefined in scipy, and by using them, you can easily perform sampling and plotting of probability density functions.
For example,
stats.norm.rvs(loc=50, scale=20, size=1000) Then you can get 1000 samples from a normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation 20, and
x = np.linspace(0, 100, 100) px = stats.norm.pdf(x, loc=50, scale=20) plt.plot(x, px) Then we can also plot the normal distribution at $0&amp;lt;x&amp;lt;100$.</description>

      <description>## table of contents  Statistics for Programmers-Table of Contents
Related article  Average, Median, Mode  Overview When calculating the average value, I generally think of adding all the values and dividing by the number of elements. However, there are several other average values, such as weighted average and geometric average, which can be used depending on the application. The commonly known method of dividing the total by the number of elements is called the arithmetic mean.</description>
