      <description>Do you all know Wear?  WEAR is a fashion coordination site and one of our services. In short, it is an SNS where you can share your fashion coordination.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but it seems to be popular to post with the face hidden by an icon. Is it because people without a face can see the coordination objectively?
However, the face hiding work is surprisingly troublesome, and I wish I could automate this&amp;hellip; so I implemented a program for automatic icon placement.</description>

      <description>---  This article is a relay article of &amp;ldquo;2020 New Year Advent Calendar TechConnect!&amp;ldquo;ofLinkInformationSystem is. TechConnect! is a self-starting advent calendar relayed by a self-made group called engineer.hanzomon. (From [Link here] Facebook)
 Since the theme was free, it will be a free article. (The technique used is serious.) I made good use of the tutorial and did image recognition.
Done A program to detect Win/Lose of Shadowverse (Steam version) has been created.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  The news is about the news that Carlos Ghosn, the former chairman of Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., broke bail conditions and traveled to Lebanon. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking for a long time, but it&amp;rsquo;s similar to Mr. Bean&amp;hellip; Left: [Carlos Ghosn](https://www.google.com/search?q=Carlos+Ghosn&amp;amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNS1gsNQxqfqi7GRWUUeSSZ6CRix8w:1577813710879&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;Ah&amp;amp;EqjQAQBQ&amp;amp;QAQBQBQ&amp;amp;QAQBQ&amp;amp;QB Right: [Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson)](https://www.google.com/search?q=rowan+atkinson&amp;amp;biw=1386&amp;amp;bih=710&amp;amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNTsdddnLF7jgPr9RTePeEMGgREpyA:1577813660092&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;saQ&amp;amp;isch&amp;amp;saq
It was a year-end and New Year holiday, so I made a little classifier using a neural network. If you google it, a lot of images of the two people will appear, so it was good for CNN, but This time, as another approach, I would like to perform classification based on the position of landmarks on the face.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Here, I will try extracting characters from the subtitles that are displayed under the political broadcast. Since there is no background, it seems to be quite binary.
Although it is possible to get the character and the position with considerable accuracy by extracting the character with the google cloud vision API, I will try to get the character by other methods here.
tesseract-ocr / pyocr First, let&amp;rsquo;s recognize characters using tesseract and pyocr.</description>
