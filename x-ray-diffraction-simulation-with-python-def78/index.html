<pre><code>It’s!

<p>Hello. This is my second post. This time I tried to simulate X-ray diffraction with Python. The full code (I use Jupyter Notebook) is GitHub<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>#X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)
X-ray diffraction is a phenomenon in which X-rays are diffracted in a crystal. X-rays are electromagnetic waves with wavelengths within a certain range (about 1 nm to 1 pm), and diffraction is the propagation of something that has the properties of waves around obstacles. When waves are diffracted, they interfere with each other to create areas that strengthen each other and areas that cancel each other out, resulting in a striped distribution. X-ray diffraction analysis identifies the crystal structure of interest by analyzing the pattern created by diffraction.
By the way, the diffraction phenomenon occurs not only in X-rays but also in electron and neutron rays, and crystal structure analysis methods using them are also widely used.</p>
<p>#Principle of crystal structure analysis by X-ray diffraction
In the pattern created by X-ray diffraction, spots that are strengthened by interference due to diffraction (where diffraction conditions are satisfied) are obtained. The relationship between the diffraction condition and the crystal structure is called the Bragg condition,
$$2dsin{\theta} = n\lambda$$
It is represented by. d is the distance between the planes (crystal planes) formed by the atoms in the crystal, $\theta$ is the angle between the crystal plane and the incident X-ray, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the X-ray.</p>
<p>#Atomic scattering factor and crystal structure factor
In the Bragg condition described above, the atom that scatters the X-ray is a point, but the electron cloud that actually scatters the X-ray is the electron cloud distributed around the atom, and the amplitude of the scattered X-ray is large. Is proportional to the electron density at the scattered location (if elastically scattered). Therefore, the amplitude f of the X-ray scattered by the atom is
$$f = \int{\rho(\vec{r})e^{2π\vec{k}\vec{r}}} dV$$
Will be. This formula is equivalent to Fourier transforming the electron density $\rho(\vec{r})$ with the scattering vector $\vec{k}$. A scattering vector is a vector defined by the component (h, k, l) in reciprocal space. This f is called an atomic scattering factor. The electron density is required to obtain the atomic scattering factor, but the electron density around the atom cannot be analytically obtained except in a simple case, so it is approximated by the Hartree-Fock method. The atomic scattering factors for each atom have already been obtained and are stored in a database, so we will use them in this calculation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the same idea can be applied to the entire crystal. The crystal structure factor F can be obtained by Fourier transforming the electron density in the crystal.
$$F(\vec{k}) = \int{\rho(\vec{r})e^{2π\vec{k}\vec{r}}} dV$$
The formula is the same as the atomic scattering factor. However, in the crystal, the electrons are distributed only around the atomic position, so this can be rewritten by the atomic coordinates (x, y, z) and the atomic scattering factor f,
$$F(hkl) = \sum_{j}{f_jT_je^{2πi(hx_j + ky_j + lz_j)}}$$
Will be. h, k, and l are the components of the scattering vector k and are also the coordinates of the lattice points (reciprocal lattice points) in the reciprocal space.
$T_j$ is the Debye-Waller factor, which I will explain later.</p>
<p>#program
Here is the actual implementation method.
First, enumerate the reciprocal lattice points hkl. Originally, only points on the Ewald sphere should be listed, but since the X-ray wavelength covers a fairly wide range on the Ewald sphere, I will list as many as possible. Hkl.csv on GitHub is an enumerated hkl file.
You also need the atomic coordinates of the unit cell of the crystal. Here, the atoms in the unit cell are enough. This time, the coordinates of the face-centered cubic lattice (fcc) are used as an example. On GitHub it is a file named pos.csv.</p>
<p>Next, construct a lattice tensor $G$ in real space from lattice constants a, b, c, $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ (these are stored as parameters beforehand).
$$
G = \left(
\begin{matrix}
a^{2} &amp; ab\cos\gamma &amp; ac\cos\beta\<br>
ba\cos\gamma &amp; b^{2} &amp; ba\cos\alpha\<br>
ca\cos\beta &amp; cb\cos\alpha &amp; c^{2}
\end{matrix}
\right)
$$
next,
$$G^{\ast} = G^{-1}$$
Therefore, if we take the inverse of this lattice tensor, we can find the lattice tensor $G^{\ast}$ in the reciprocal space.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Although the values in the database are used for the atomic scattering factor, the atomic scattering factor is a function that depends on sin θ/λ, so only the coefficient is listed in the database. To assemble from the coefficients,
$$f(\frac{\sin\theta}{\lambda}) = \sum_{j=1}^{4}{a_j e^{-b_j(\frac{\sin\theta}{λ})^ 2}} + c$$
will do. $a_j$, $b_j$, c are the coefficients. In the program, data was used assuming Na atom.</p>
<p>Now we have to explain the Debye-Waller factor.
The Debye-Waller factor is a factor that compensates for the effects of thermal vibrations. Debye-Waller factor of isotropic thermal oscillation is
$$T = e^{-B(\frac{\sin\theta}{\lambda})^2}$$
It is represented by. B is the isotropic atomic displacement parameter.
If the thermal oscillation is not isotropic (which is called anisotropic), it is more complicated, using the $3\times3$ symmetric matrix $\beta$
$$T = e^{-h^{\mathrm{T}} β h}$$
Will be.
This time, considering isotropic thermal vibration, B = 2.0. I searched for the value of the atomic displacement parameter, but I couldn&rsquo;t find it. Excuse me.</p>
<p>The crystal structure factor is calculated based on the atomic scattering factor and the atomic coordinates of the unit cell of the crystal.
$$F_i(x, y, z, h_i, k_i, l_i, f_i) = f_i\sum_{j}{e^{2πi(hx_j + ky_j + lz_j)}}$$
As you can see, the crystal structure factor is complex.</p>
<p>If you plot the square of the absolute value of the obtained crystal structure factor (since it is the square of the absolute value of the scattering amplitude, it becomes the scattering intensity) with $2\theta$ as the horizontal axis, a plot like that obtained by X-ray diffraction It can be obtained. Since the incident X-ray angle is $\theta$ and the scattered X-ray angle is $\theta$, it is customary to take the horizontal axis at $2\theta$.</p>
<p>#result
The plot looks like this:
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/467266/73825313-70b6-2f4d-8b92-34f73e5205f5.png" alt="xrd_sim1.png"></p>
<p>Bragg angles are rounded to two decimal places.
In this plot, the scattering intensity appears as a delta function only at the angle of reflection that satisfies the Bragg condition, but in actual X-ray diffraction, the scattering intensity peak has a width. Let&rsquo;s reproduce the spread of that peak.</p>
<p>When you want to make the delta function wider, the first thing you can think of is convolution with a Gaussian function (Gaussian). The so-called Gaussian convolution.
The following is the plot obtained by convolving the Gaussian function in the previous plot. The variance is set to a value that looks like it.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/467266/bf12cd6e-35fa-3096-777f-ee5963222f5b.png" alt="xrd_sim2.png">
You can see that the skirt has a little width. As anyone who has seen X-ray diffraction measurement data can understand, this plot looks a little narrower than the actual one. Actually, the Gaussian function is suitable for expressing the behavior such as thermal vibration of particles, but it is not suitable for expressing the peak of such a spectrum.
So, let&rsquo;s convolve with the Lorenz function used to express the peak of the spectrum. The Lorentz function is as follows.
$$L = \frac{1}{1 + (\frac{x}{γ})^2}$$
$\gamma$ is called the half width, which is the peak width at half the peak height. How this function spreads depends on this parameter.</p>

    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> lorentz
</code></pre></div><p>The following is what is actually folded. Again, the half-width value is an appropriate value.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/467266/457e4573-158d-ab8a-e61b-9e32f2cee1e3.png" alt="xrd_sim3.png">
It has a wider base than the Gaussian function above. It looks like the peak of X-ray diffraction.
That said, the Lorenz function alone is not accurate. Since the atoms in the crystal oscillate with temperature (there is zero oscillation even at absolute zero), the Gaussian behavioral thermal oscillation also affects the peak broadening. Therefore, by convolving Lorentz function and Gaussian function with arbitrary weight, the peak can be expressed more accurately.The convolution of Lorenz function and Gaussian function is called Voigt function. The Voigt function is faster to make using the complex error function than to make it foolproof by convolving the Lorentz function and the Gaussian function. I don&rsquo;t know well because of lack of study, but it seems that the real part of complex error function is like Voigt function. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

Although I tried it, it is more like expressing the spread with only Lorentz function. The Voigt function requires the half width of each of the Gaussian function part and the Lorentz function part as a parameter, but this time it is set appropriately. By making the FWHMs theoretically close to each other, it may approach the actual peak broadening.</p>
<p>#Diffraction image
In X-ray diffraction, in addition to the plots shown above, an image that is a copy of the X-ray diffraction, which is called a diffraction image, can be obtained. Since the reciprocal lattice can be seen in the diffraction image, I will make it as a bonus this time.</p>
<p>As an implementation, generate an array of numpy.zeros() with an arbitrary size, and enter the value of |F|^2 only at the place where the reflection condition is satisfied, and convolve the Gaussian function so that it looks like a spot. I will.</p>

    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> gauss
</code></pre></div><p>In the diffraction image, only the reciprocal lattice points perpendicular to the direction of the incident X-ray appear as spots. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the incident X-ray direction in addition to the above conditions. Taking the incident X-ray direction as [001], take the inner product and extract only the reflection that becomes 0. This processing is easy when it is [001], but complicated processing will be necessary when the incident direction is [110] or [111].
In Python, the array can be directly converted into an image with matplotlib.pyplot.imshow(), so use an image with black and white contrast.</p>

<p>#Summary
I tried to simulate X-ray diffraction. Diffraction theory is complicated, but the computer processing itself is simple, so it may be a good teaching material for understanding X-ray diffraction.
To tell the truth, in order to perform a precise simulation, we have to consider more factors than the ones implemented this time (Lorentz-polarization factor, selective orientation function, etc.). In addition, the parameters set properly this time (atomic displacement parameters, half-width of Voigt function) should also be accurate. Then, can these parameters be calculated theoretically? These parameters are made up of various factors that affect each other in a complex manner, so it may be difficult to obtain them analytically even if analogy can be made from the dominant factors.
In order to obtain accurate values for the above parameters, we will combine the experimental values with the simulations and reduce the error. So, the last article <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
