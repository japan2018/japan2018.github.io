YouDev is a service that focuses on individual developers to let them know more about them (I want to know&amp;hellip;).
Even if the service is recognized, I think that the developers have not hit the spot, so individual developers may not only appeal the services released by themselves, but also the developers themselves. I created it.
I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for individual developers, so I&amp;rsquo;m an individual developer!</description>

I will not talk about installing Docker in detail, so if you are interested, please check the original article! (Here)willhelp.)
Also, as a clear difference from the previous article, Django thinks as an API delivery server and assumes Vue.</description>

You can easily create a Web service with your needs by automatically synchronizing the database of Web services in the world and adding added value that the original family does not have.

Note: What is ASGI?:briefcase: ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is the spiritual successor to WSGI and aims to provide a standard interface between asynchronous-enabled Python web servers, frameworks, and applications. While WSGI provided the standard for synchronous Python apps, ASGI provides both asynchronous and synchronous apps with a backwards-compatible implementation of WSGI and multiple servers and application frameworks.</description>

      <description>It seems that a tool called Sourcetrail has been released and it seems interesting, so I tried it.  There was an article you have already touched, but it is charming. Ubuntu.
I used it, and the big repository that I can think of was Django, so I will try it with a combination of Python and Django.
Install SourceTrail You can download it from Sourcetrail(GitHub) Release Page. Download 64-bit Linux tar file</description>

      <description>This is my first time joining the Advent Calendar. Thank you.  Overview My hobby is Pythonista. This year I introduced to Django and made a website. This time, for the same Django beginner as I am, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to write a rough guide to how to get rid of things that will bother you and make you cry. It is Server Error (500).
At this time, try to display the error content on the screen even temporarily, output a log, or notify Slack of the error content.</description>

      <description>My name is mogken and I am in the business planning office of an IT venture company.  Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about changing jobs, and I&amp;rsquo;m studying programming to make it appeal to me. It&amp;rsquo;s not so appealing to say that you&amp;rsquo;re just studying with your mouth, so I made a simple web app with Python and Django, built it on AWS, and released the source to Github.
This time, I would like to explain the program (Python) I wrote myself, which also serves as an output for the fixation of knowledge within me.</description>

      <description>Leave it as a memo instead.  It is a premise that the instance is staggered.
##Install Python3 The version of Python originally included in Amazon Linux is 2.7.12. That&amp;rsquo;s why I will install Python 3 series this time. Fortunately, Python3 is collected in YUM&amp;rsquo;s amzn-main repository.

      <description>## I was annoyed by ImportError  Install python with homebrew and django with pip. However, it fails when the server starts.
$ python manage.py runserver  ImportError: No module named django.core.management
 Actually, Python is included in the Mac from the beginning Launch the Terminal app and check the version
$ python --version  Python 2.7.5
 I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice this, and I thought it was Python installed with homebrew.</description>
