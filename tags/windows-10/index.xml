      <description>2020-03-10  Update1: How many types of Python does your macOS contain? I had 401 kinds.  Update2: Karikan Cancer Insurance
2020-03-15 Update3: The title was Window 10 and it was fixed to Windows 10. It was an unconscious typo.
The title is fanatic. On WSL Ubuntu 18.04, there were 3 types via pyenv + 2 types from OS, for a total of 10 types.
