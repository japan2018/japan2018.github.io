Until now, I have lived such a life that I replaced the dates on the horizontal axis with numbers and plotted and escaped. However, it&amp;rsquo;s different now. You can now plot well with the horizontal axis set to time series!</description>

      <description>#Introduction  This article was posted as the sixth day of Cisco Advent Calendar 2019 by Cisco Systems LLC.
Seven years have passed since the SuperVision team at the University of Toronto, Canada won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2012 in 2012. At this time, by using a model using deep learning, modeling in machine learning and deep learning is often done in the third AI boom, and it is common sense nowadays to use machine learning/deep learning for AI.</description>
