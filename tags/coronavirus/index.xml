      <description># Add mortality and reinfection rates to the basic SIR model  Mortality rate and reinfection of the class cl_SIRbetaInput created in the previous article, &amp;ldquo;Implement the mathematical model of infectious disease &amp;ldquo;SIR model&amp;rdquo; with OpenModelica&amp;rdquo; (https://qiita.com/nobby-n/items/48803407f67f62b2c8f9)&amp;quot; Let&amp;rsquo;s create a full version with a percentage added.
*Corrected because we found an error in the mortality formula in the first post.
   (Corrected on May 13, 2020) Revised again.    Prerequisites for this model</description>

      <title>I tried fitting exponential function and logistics function to the number of COVID-19 positive patients in Tokyo</title>

      <description>#Background  There was a person who fitted the trend of the number of COVID-19 infected people in the world to an exponential function and a logistic function and calculated the doubling period (https://github.com/aatishb/covid), so I cloned it. I applied it to the data on the number of patients published by Tokyo.
When it comes to Tokyo, the difference in the situation depending on the region is mixed into one distribution if it is national data, so it is easier to fit it to an ideal infection explosion model in a limited area.</description>
