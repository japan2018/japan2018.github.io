<pre><code>#Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>Hello. I am @sho-hata, a new graduate web engineer.</p>
<p>In this article, I read ** a book that I was at the level of index finger typing ** that I had read in a year and a half from when I decided to become a Web engineer! I would like to introduce it without looking back.</p>
<p>We hope that this article will be a stimulus for those who have read it, and we hope that it will be of use to you!</p>
<p>#Books I have read</p>
<p>I was a <strong>do amateur</strong>, such as &ldquo;What is a browser? Isn&rsquo;t it a home page?&rdquo; &ldquo;Server&hellip;?&rdquo; **:thinking:.</p>
<p>Therefore, despite the lack of basic knowledge about languages and the Internet, I had to spend a year and a half trying to smash my hands on difficult books.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want anyone who wants to become a Web engineer to step on the same ruts.
So, not only from the books I&rsquo;ve read,</p>
<ul>
<li>** Books with a high priority to read **</li>
<li>** A book that I felt like &ldquo;You should keep this book alone!&rdquo; **</li>
</ul>
<p>About **, a <strong>mark (★)</strong> is added.</p>
<p>I hope you can use it as a reference.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>** A book where you can learn what <code>HTTP</code>, <code>URI</code>, and <code>REST</code> are ** from the history of the Web.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this book, I deepened my understanding of the vague **HTTP methods <code>POST</code> and <code>GET</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A book with essential knowledge for those who make web applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mastering-tcpip--introduction--6th-edition-httpswwwamazoncojpdp4274224473">[&ldquo;Mastering TCP/IP -Introduction- (6th Edition)&rdquo;&rdquo; (https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4274224473/)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A book that explains carefully about <code>TCP/IP</code> which is one of the communication protocols supporting the present Internet ** with a rich parable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I finally learned from this book, &ldquo;What is a router doing?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, ** It is a &ldquo;communication protocol introduction&rdquo; book rather than &ldquo;network introduction&rdquo;. **Before reading, keep in mind the range of FE (Basic Information Processing) network ◎</p>

<h3 id="web-api-the-good-partshttpswwwamazoncojpdp4873116864"><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4873116864/">&ldquo;Web API The Good Parts&rdquo;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A book where you can learn the ideas you need to design a good Web API</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that at some stage of your study, you will have the opportunity to design a Web API and create a SPA, so I think that reading it at that time will deepen your understanding of the Web API.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>** A book that explains why &ldquo;concepts&rdquo; such as functions, types, and classes exist in programming languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why reading this book</p>
<p>-<strong>Are there different languages</strong>
-** Do each language have the same or different characteristics **</p>
<p>Can understand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a term definition page at the end of the sentence, but the term definition of &ldquo;infinite loop&rdquo; that is too fashionable ** is written.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This is a test reference book, not a technical book. The contents of FE (Basic Information Technology Engineer Examination) are <strong>regardless of whether you take the examination</strong> or not, as education for an engineer <strong>you should learn it</strong>. I think.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Significant salary increase because you passed FE/AP! It doesn&rsquo;t mean &hellip; and I struggle if I don&rsquo;t have this range of knowledge, so I think <strong>systematic knowledge is worth learning</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I felt that <strong>fragmentary knowledge was linked together</strong> after I passed FE.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>** A book where you can learn how a computer that understands only 0 and 1 can interpret and execute your code **.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not directly related to web development, but when you read it, you will be able to imagine what is happening behind the program.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="programming-language-front-end">Programming language (front end)</h2>
<p>As for the front end, it is almost complete with information on the Web, so the number of books is small.</p>
<h3 id="vuejs-to-learn-from-the-basicshttpswwwamazoncojpdp4863542453"><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4863542453/">&ldquo;Vue.js to learn from the basics&rdquo;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ideal for those who have a back-end spindle but think that they have to study the front library properly (I did).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**You can learn <strong>basic contents such as operation of virtual DOM</strong> in a hands-on format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After reading this book, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/Vue-js-Nuxt-js%E8%B6%85%E5%85%A5%E9%96%80-%E6%8E%8C%E7%94%B0%E6%B4%A5%E8%80%B6%E4%B9%83/dp/4798056596">Vue.js &amp; Nuxt.js super introduction</a>frameworkfromlibraryIthinkitisgoodtoproceedwithlearning(asIamnow).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="programming-language-backend">Programming language (backend)</h2>
<h4>*Caution</h4>
I like **Python** and chose **Python × Django** as the backend, so the technical books are biased towards Python. **Therefore, **it may not be helpful to those who make Ruby/Ruby on Rails their first language/framework. **
<p>However, I think that many people will start developing web applications not only with Ruby on Rails and Laravel but also with Flask and Django.</p>
<p>I hope you will refer to this article as one of the criteria for choosing books.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>** A book that is widely and shallowly written **, and is a perfect introduction to Python.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a great book for beginners because it is fun to read and there is a guide for ** future learning roadmap **.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is another <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4800711592/">Introduction to the easiest Python introductory classroom</a> as the first introductory book, but I recommend this time because it is likely to be unsatisfactory. I didn&rsquo;t list it.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A book that provides a complete explanation of the basics of **Django&rsquo;s functionality, one of Python&rsquo;s web frameworks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike Ruby on Rails, the Python web framework is still very informative in Japanese, which was very helpful at the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When developing a web application with Django, along with <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/start/">Django Tutorial</a>and<a href="https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/ja/">DjangoGirlsTutorial</a> How to use instead of the guidebook</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>** Practical edition ** including contents such as how to deploy to production environment **. Together with the books mentioned above, I feel like I have a better understanding of Django.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is also a polite explanation about OAuth in the chapter that introduces around social authentication ◎</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A book where you can learn how to create a web API using the Django REST Framework</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This book introduces <strong>How to build a SPA using Vue.js on the front and Django Rest Framework on the back</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you read this book, I think that you can prepare SPA with some Javascript library + Django rest Framework.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A book that introduces Python programs as tips that can be used in daily work such as file operations and updating spreadsheet data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-engineers are also supposed to be readers, and there is a lot of information about environment construction etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To some extent, I think it is <strong>for people who have touched other languages</strong>. It was called &ldquo;Tutorial&rdquo;, so I read it in the early days of learning, but I found it difficult for beginners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, there is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/ja/3/tutorial/">Python official document</a> on the Web, so you may want to read this rather than buying a book.</p>

<p>A book that gives you a deep knowledge of <strong>Pythonic writing</strong>.</p>
</li>

<p>Especially, the chapters on processing around encode and decode and the chapter on parallel processing are recommended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**It is not recommended for beginners because it is not intended for beginners as it is not something that can be created immediately after reading **, but **I think that this book is recommended for anyone who likes Python **. I will. It&rsquo;s very thick afterwards.</p>

<p>**※ From here on, it&rsquo;s really a shame. **</p>
<p>Originally, I was only studying to become a primary school teacher for four years at university, and my graduate school also advanced to education.
Half a year after I entered, I had a chance to attend a <strong>machine learning study session for non-engineers</strong> held by Microsoft in connection with programming education at an elementary school, and that was a turning point in my life**.</p>
<p>My first impression of the engineer was</p>
<p>** &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing something terrible on a ridiculous scale using a technology I don&rsquo;t really understand!&quot;**.</p>
<p>The content of the study session was ~~ I didn&rsquo;t understand well at that time~~, but ** the evangelists who talk happily about the technology were very attractive. I also wanted to do so, and from there I fell into programming.</p>
<p><strong>I wrote the code for the first time</strong> was a simple one that &ldquo;displays &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo; in the html <code>h1</code> tag&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m embarrassed that I didn&rsquo;t know anything at the time* * I misunderstood that the program I wrote was seen from all the homepages (* browsers) of the world..! (*Of course it is localhost, and html is the markup language in the first place).</p>
<p>If you decide to aim to be an engineer from other fields as well as yourself, I think there is a chance to think **.</p>
<p>**I want you to cherish it forever. **</p>
<p>**I think it&rsquo;s really difficult to study programming while doing other things (work, research). **
I also felt depressed on the background and remarks of strong people on SNS, cried by parents when I stopped the way of teachers, I like programming, but I wonder why I do not have such a sense &hellip; There were many things.</p>
<p>**At that time, what helped me was the emotional event at midnight that prompted me to become an engineer. **</p>
<p>As a result, I was able to start a career as a web engineer with some connections.</p>
<p>I hope that reading this article will inspire those who are aiming to become Web engineers.
Thank you for reading until the end. :bow:</p>
