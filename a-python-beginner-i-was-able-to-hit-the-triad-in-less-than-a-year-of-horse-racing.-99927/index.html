<pre><code># **Introduction**
</code></pre>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but I will omit the explanation of horse racing terms. I think it is read by people who are interested in horse racing.</p>
<p>Information published on netkeiba.com (information taken by scraping)
There are various types such as pedigree, running time, and mileage. As a premise, the scraped data is used as a model
When I fit it, I don&rsquo;t expect anything. It is necessary to select, organize and analyze information.</p>
<p>Before deciding how to analyze the data, first of all, as a hypothesis,</p>
<p>** There were various straight lines from the start of the race to the final straight line, but with 3 halong climbs, the horse ran with all the power remaining
The order of arrival is determined in the order in which the goal is passed**</p>
<p>will do. This may seem obvious, but it narrows down the information to consider.
The data I use to proceed with the analysis is</p>
<p>·lap time
→Evaluate the pace and race grade of the entire race
・Type of race Turf or dirt/distance
→ Subdivision of various race types</p>
<p>Data for each horse
・Each horse passing through the corner, up 3f time
→ Classification of limbs, evaluation of the last straight line in horses with the same limbs</p>
<p>Supplement 1: Jockey, horse name, pedigree, frame order, running time etc. are not considered
Supplement 2: The make debut race is not included in the analysis because it does not consider the pedigree and the jockey</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it was a long introduction, but it was an introduction.</p>
<h1 id="about-actual-forecasting-work"><strong>About actual forecasting work</strong></h1>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s create training data to have AI predict the race.
It is useless because the data of the lower-ranked horses are created and are not entangled in the betting ticket. Create data for 1-6 horses in past races.</p>
<p>Example:
scr.csv
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/534312/189359a6-97a2-894c-1013-13e445243cb5.jpeg" alt="scr.jpg">
train.csv
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/534312/3a45f475-4a67-a3d9-e02e-a7c4ce5af5c3.jpeg" alt="train.jpg"></p>
<p>Just a few lines.</p>
<p>The row data scraped by scr. What train calculates such as tidying up and standard deviation (training data)
Even if it is troublesome, write out a new csv file firmly.</p>
<p>If you create training data well, you may get good results without worrying about the parameters of the model,
I&rsquo;m groping for the time being.</p>
<p>With the data derived using this model, I was able to buy a 4-head BOX and hit a horse or a triple.
Expected to be published on a certain horse racing prediction site

<p>Even in the race that I took off, I think that I was able to make a good one, such as two in three.

<p>#<strong>Postscript</strong></p>
<p>Things that can still be done as improvement measures
・Pedigree
・Jockey
・Frame order
・Season
・Negative features</p>
<p>Assembling a forecast based on pedigree or jockey is the real pleasure of horse racing, so I want to do it someday. But I can&rsquo;t even imagine how to do it.
Would you like to count the horsemen and the horses that were the top three in the race? Exploring.
Although it is said that turf has an advantage in inner frame, there are times when it doesn&rsquo;t matter. On the dirt, the outer frame is more advantageous because the riding ground is less rough.
Depending on the season, there will be a difference in power between stallion mares depending on the season. To be honest I don&rsquo;t know at all because I have been racing for less than a year.
I think that data scientists will exchange opinions about this area with horse racing lovers.</p>
<p>Negative feature quantity is the spirit of trying to squeeze out a horse that will definitely wear 4 or less.
The aim is to avoid wasting money on dangerous popular horses and distracting hole horses.
Also, by making predictions from other perspectives, we will be able to be more convinced of the four horses who will buy BOX.</p>
<p>The development language is python and the framework is AWS/Cloud9/jupyternotebook.
I would like to write an article when I can afford the detailed code.
The actual forecast is open to the public on the cash register website, so please come and visit us.</p>
