</p>
<pre><code>I am a 4th year university student studying reinforcement learning. I have already graduated.
</code></pre>
<p>I started researching simply thinking that I could make money with the power of AI.
Probably because it is financial related, I can not find any information even if I search &hellip;
So, my research this year &ldquo;Acquisition of investment strategy by deep reinforcement learning&rdquo;
I&rsquo;d like to write about it and be helpful for someone somewhere.
(I haven&rsquo;t published in a conference, so don&rsquo;t be afraid&hellip; I won&rsquo;t find it even if I search for a paper.)
(Although I wrote that it is a study on making money, it is not an information product. There is no guidance to strange URLs, so please feel free to read it.)</p>
<p>This time (1) is introduced,
(2)(3) I would like to explain the actual theory and program.</p>
<p>Also, the contents posted this time are not the things that I learned in classes etc., but all the contents that I learned by myself. I&rsquo;m sure you can find many mistakes, but I would appreciate it if you could look warmly.
Thank you.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-reinforcement-learning-policy-gradient-method">What is reinforcement learning (policy gradient method)?</h1>
<p>First, I got interested in reinforcement learning. Let&rsquo;s take a brief look at reinforcement learning using &ldquo;AlphaGo&rdquo; as an example.</p>
<p>##AlphaGo
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/351881/c49b39d5-a6ea-f5df-1564-4659d085a0bd.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Roughly speaking, (It&rsquo;s really rough, sorry for the experts)</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/351881/61846385-f430-9b23-02c7-fb8b07a2cbab.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<ol>
<li>Get the current board from the Go environment</li>
<li>Reinforcement learning agent reads the board</li>
<li>Output <strong>probability distribution</strong> of hitting hands</li>
<li>Probabilistically determine the next move from the probability distribution</li>
</ol>
<p>That is a series of steps to decide the move from the board.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output <strong>probability distribution</strong> of hitting hands</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is Miso, depending on the current board
It is better to hit next, and if the hand that hits is close to winning, the probability is high,
If you hit it with a pinch, you have a <strong>low probability</strong>
The goal is to output an &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; probability distribution.</p>
<p>Then, it becomes possible to input and output such a reinforcement learning agent,
It is a familiar &ldquo;neural network&rdquo; in deep learning,
The role of reinforcement learning is to &ldquo;properly&rdquo; learn the probability distribution output by the neural network.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the two are called deep reinforcement learning.</p>
<h3 id="this-is-great-in-alpha-go">This is great in Alpha Go</h3>
<p>AlphaGo Motoi Deep Reinforcement Learning
It can be said that the algorithm &ldquo;learns an appropriate probability distribution according to the current environment&rdquo;.
The great thing about this algorithm is</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Learning without using the knowledge discovered by a person called &ldquo;jojo&rdquo;&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Converged in real time&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;It is far stronger than humans&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean&hellip;
The knowledge that people have discovered while fighting for decades and hundreds is so easily lost that
It is this deep reinforcement learning that exerts a strong power in Go.</p>
<h2 id="application-to-stock-investment">Application to stock investment</h2>
<p>For the time being, leave the detailed theory of deep reinforcement learning
Is it possible to use the algorithm that &ldquo;learns an appropriate probability distribution according to the current environment&rdquo; for stock prices? I thought.</p>
<p>When people buy or sell stocks,
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/351881/5e4821a0-5025-4a65-02ef-82ccdc08ed27.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>You trade according to price movements from the past to the present like this.
Of course, I don&rsquo;t know what the future is, so I sometimes fail.</p>
<p>The reinforcement learning agent reads this and reads the stock price.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/351881/a6fa6367-b6c0-20a9-abcc-c480c7ede34d.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it possible to trade by converting to probability?</p>
<p>If you can obtain the probability of buying and selling at the next time without pinpointing the stock price
It is quite possible to make money.</p>
<p>Therefore
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/351881/09361232-af3a-5341-3bf2-0ce39aa82c10.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>That is the goal and the content of the program.</p>
<h1 id="about-results">About results</h1>
<p>If the result is bad, it makes no sense to read it, so I will put it out first.
However, I am aware that there are many points that are lacking in explanation. I will post more detailed results and methods at a later date, so now with this reinforcement learning method the probabilities have converged, and whether it surpasses humans, it is possible to make some profit? I hope you will think about it.</p>

<ul>
<li>The blue line is the value of the neural network error function.
-It can be seen that the probabilities converge as the value gets closer to 0.</li>
<li>The orange line is the average profit gained during the 50 days of study.</li>
</ul>
<p>The average profit is increasing with each step.</p>
<p>Regarding buying and selling,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Take a buying position&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Take a Sell Position (Short Sell)&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Cancel or have no position&rdquo;
The following three outputs are prepared, and it is the situation that one unit is bought or sold under the premise that one unit of Nikkei 225 stock price can be bought (sold) without fail.</p>

<p>Reinforcement learning algorithm</p>

<p>Actual program</p>

<p>I would like to post about later.</p>
<p>It may be a long post, but please be patient.
Thank you.</p>
