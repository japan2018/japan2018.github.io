      <description>#Introduction  The other day, I will introduce how to implement a gradation picker like Substance Designer, which Mr. Ando announced in PySide Study Group, in Houdini. Introduction to Andou-san&amp;rsquo;s gradation picker, commentary article

      <description>*This article is the 14th day of Maya Advent Calendar 2019. *  I&amp;rsquo;m very sorry, but I will participate.

This time I briefly wrote about how to use it on the pyside GUI. Let&amp;rsquo;s change the label text by looking at the selected node type.</description>

      <description>This article is the 8th day article of [**Houdini Advent Calender 2019**](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/houdini).  Nowadays, Houdini is used in various industries, and I think various HDAs are being developed by various companies. On the other hand, if management and documentation are not maintained, **you can not understand how to use HDA created by others, and you can not know what kind of HDA exists **.
This article will show you how to create tooltips and your own documentation for the parameters shown below.</description>
