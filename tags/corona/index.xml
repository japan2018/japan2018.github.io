      <description>#Background  There was a person who fitted the trend of the number of COVID-19 infected people in the world to an exponential function and a logistic function and calculated the doubling period (https://github.com/aatishb/covid), so I cloned it. I applied it to the data on the number of patients published by Tokyo.
When it comes to Tokyo, the difference in the situation depending on the region is mixed into one distribution if it is national data, so it is easier to fit it to an ideal infection explosion model in a limited area.</description>
