      <description>#Introduction  In the course of Udemy, I roughly understood the contents of the blockchain, so I implemented it. I implement it by myself based on the contents of the course. Mr. Jun Sakai, an active engineer of Silicon Valley, teaches in this course, and by taking the course, you will be able to create the following programs without looking at them. This post also implements wallet and proof_of_work that are not implemented, so if you are interested, please take this course.</description>
