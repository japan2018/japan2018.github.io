      <description>First Edition: March 10, 2020 &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;  Author: Soichi Takashige, Masahiro Ito, Hitachi, Ltd.
#Introduction In this post, I will introduce the design know-how of data preprocessing and the results of performance verification of data preprocessing when designing a system incorporating a machine learning model.
The second article introduces know-how for performance improvement and verification results in data preprocessing using Python.
Post list:
 Data preprocessing for systems that use machine learning Performance Verification of Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning (Numerical Data) (Part 1) (Posted) Performance Verification of Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning (Numerical Data) (Part 2)  #About the benchmark (BigBench) referenced in the performance verification Before introducing design know-how and performance verification results, we will introduce the benchmarks that were referenced as references in verification.</description>
