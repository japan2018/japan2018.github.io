<pre><code>#About the standing position of each book
</code></pre>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried about what kind of axis to explain the standing position, but this time I tried to position it as &ldquo;arbitrary and prejudiced&rdquo; on the two axes of &ldquo;target reader level&rdquo; and &ldquo;relationship with time series&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/275572/991fdb22-0d30-7a93-a62b-3125386f762e.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>#Introduction
At work, I use various methods for various data regarding data analysis, but when I analyze it, there are surprisingly many time series data.</p>
<p>Numerical prediction and abnormality detection are often recorded along with the time.
In order to add knowledge about this time series data, I read the book comprehensively, and I decided to add knowledge.
This time, I would like to help everyone to buy books by reviewing &ldquo;What is written in which book and how is it related to other books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Check the standing position of this book&rdquo;
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a time series book, this book can be included&rdquo;
Please tell me if you have any.</p>
<p>This is an article with the same concept as <a href="https://logics-of-blue.com/book-guide-time-series-analysis/">Book Guide for Time Series Analysis</a>.</p>
<p>#Which is better, python or R for time series data?</p>
<ul>
<li>Both python and R have abundant library packages of data analysis, and the speed from paper to implementation is fast</li>
<li>There are many similar things that both python and R can do visualization and functions</li>
<li>Python is advantageous for deep learning</li>
<li>Machine learning is led by python with excellent scikit-learn</li>
<li>R also has attractive auxiliary libraries such as tidymodels and recipes</li>
<li>R is the lead because there is only a &ldquo;statistical language&rdquo; for &ldquo;easiness of execution&rdquo; of tests and visualization</li>
<li>Stan for MCMC is available in R or python</li>
<li>** R leads the time series modeling **</li>
</ul>
<p>From the above, it is recommended to select R language if you want to learn time series.</p>

<p>#Methods and types of time series forecast</p>
<p>The methods used for forecasting time series data, including time series modeling, are (* arbitrarily) divided into 4 groups.</p>
<ol>
<li>Autoregressive system</li>
<li>State space system</li>
<li>Machine learning regression</li>
<li>Deep learning</li>
</ol>
<p>###1. Autoregressive system
<strong>AR, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, ARIMAX, SARIMAX, ARCH, GARCH, VAR</strong></p>
<p>It is a group of time-series modeling methods that have been around for a long time, and they are not exhausted enough to be used in modern times.</p>
<p>Time-series data is expressed as a function by decomposing it into several components such as “trend”, “autocorrelation (cycle)”, “season (regular cycle)”, and “error”. Method.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/275572/c37a8fe3-1d7b-9311-83de-5635a51233d4.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>↑ Break it down like this (the figure shows the output of prophet).</p>
<p>In order to decompose the data into these components, it is necessary to perform engineering such as <strong>auto-regression, unit root test, d-difference, AIC model selection</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>It may seem difficult, but in modern times, autoregressive modeling is basically automated, so the hurdle is low.
However, theoretical knowledge is also necessary to &ldquo;understand/consider&rdquo; the modeling results.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know &ldquo;what kind of theory you use to calculate,&rdquo;
・Whether the model is incorrect as a result of automatic determination
・Is it data that can be modeled by autoregression in the first place?
You will overlook important parts such as.</p>
<p>(I read several books and realized again the importance of understanding the theory of machine learning.)</p>
<p>###2. State space system</p>
<p>We will model time-series data based on the idea that it can be obtained by &ldquo;probabilistically adding values&rdquo; to numerical values called &ldquo;states&rdquo;.
Consider two mathematical formulas, &ldquo;observation equation&rdquo; and &ldquo;state equation&rdquo;.
When modeling the temperature in Japan, we can first think of a periodic waveform of hot summers and cold winters.</p>
<p>However, in the summer of one year, there was a lot of rain and the average temperature dropped.</p>
<p>When a periodic waveform is treated as a Japanese temperature model, such changes cannot be predicted, but
If the waveform is corrected from the record &ldquo;whether it rained&rdquo;, it may reflect the decrease in temperature. It is a method of making a model based on the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it raining?&rdquo; here is made up as an equation representing the &ldquo;state.&rdquo;
Since the “state” is considered to affect the data, there is a merit that it is easier to explain the change by checking the value of the state when considering “why the value became that”.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;filter&rdquo; in the state space model refers to the algorithm used to create and correct &ldquo;states&rdquo;.
In the process of making a state space model, the probability density function corresponding to the posterior probability becomes complicated, and it becomes necessary to generate random numbers by MCMC in order to estimate its parameters.</p>
<p>###3. Machine learning regression</p>
<p>There is a regression model as a machine learning method.
It is a method of predicting numerical values by using surrounding explanatory variables and past time values instead of time series modeling.
Methods such as SVM (SVR) in the old days, GBDT system, LightGNM, etc. have been active in the competition of data analysis recently, and they have a wide range of applications such as &ldquo;solving classification problems, fast calculation, handling multivariate&rdquo;. It feels like it&rsquo;s being used casually.</p>
<p>If you know time series modeling, theory, and it is easy to formulate, select time series modeling.
If you feel it is multivariate or difficult to formulate, try regression using another machine learning model.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the approach like this good?</p>
<p>Read the Time Series book so that you can decide when to choose time series modeling.
If you want to know about machine learning (classification/regression), I would like to introduce the following books.</p>

<p>###4. Deep learning</p>
<p>When using deep learning on series data, RNN and improved LSTM are often used.
Sometimes, in the case of multivariate, it may be solved as a regression with a multi-layered NN based on the idea introduced in “3. Regression of machine learning”.
This is a common problem in deep learning, but it can be troublesome when you are asked to explain predicted values.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any knowledge about the books I can introduce here, so I will omit them.
(Isn&rsquo;t a book like Mr. Sugago good? I&rsquo;m waiting for a book recommendation.)</p>
<p>If you want to give yourself some advice when you read #11,</p>
<p>In the future, if you would like to recommend to beginners to begin time series modeling and analysis, do the following.
I didn&rsquo;t think about &ldquo;prediction (regression) in machine learning model&rdquo; here, but I thought about the way to understand &ldquo;time series modeling&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basics of time series analysis and state space model (cover of Hayabusa)
-Easy explanation of the basics of time series/autoregressive models with simple formulas
-<strong>AR,ARMA,ARIMA,SARIMA,ARIMAX,SARIMAX,VAR (part), state space, Kalman filter, MCMC</strong>
-You can learn the basics such as ** unit root, ADF test **
-Story-ready and easy to read
-Personally the sentences were easy to understand (easy to read)</li>
<li>R econometric analysis
-Touch the R language
-Know Hayashimoto&rsquo;s autoregressive model and <strong>ARCH,GARCH</strong></li>
<li>Time series analysis understood from the basics
-Further refine the knowledge of state space
-** Kalman filter, particle filter, MCMC**-Read the sidebar about the Kalman filter if you want to take the path of time series modeling</li>
<li>VAR empirical study learned in R
-Use VAR function in R
-Understand multivariate time series modeling methods (<strong>VAR</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>By now, I think that you have enough power to fight using time series modeling techniques.</p>
<p>#For further progress and growth</p>
<ul>
<li>Time series analysis of economic/finance data
-Understand the mathematical background of time series modeling</li>
</ul>
<p>#If you read for a policy that you want to grow from a beginner</p>
<ul>
<li>Econometrics
-Understand the basics of data analysis, statistics, and machine learning
-&quot;** Finance Machine Learning **&rdquo; if you want to move to finance and economy
-If you want to polish as a machine learning engineer, &ldquo;** win with kaggle **&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>#that&rsquo;s all
So far, I read the time series books and thoughts, thoughts, book reviews and recommendations.</p>
<p>・&ldquo;Time series data analysis that can be used immediately in the field&rdquo; is for the basics, and because it is old, there are few introductions of time series modeling methods, so the priority is low</p>
<ul>
<li>Although &ldquo;Econometric Economic Analysis by R&rdquo; is an old book, there are many time series modeling methods to deal with, and basic R operation methods are also described, so I thought that it can often be absorbed and raised the priority a little.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope it helps you in your learning</p>
