<pre><code># Introduction Do you learn new programming languages every year?
</code></pre>
<p>It&rsquo;s poem&rsquo;s time to borrow the place of java advent calendar. I wrote about Java in the Android project a few years ago. The complement of modern IDEs is great.
Today&rsquo;s story is what everyone loves and what programming language to learn. However, the adult version.</p>
<p>Now, everyone who has been writing code for some years in some language. As a matter of course, Java is something I have learned and I have written at work, I think that most people write only Java. Do you guys learn a new language every year, as somewhere says?
I study halfway every year.</p>
<p>But maybe, I think, for most of you, there aren&rsquo;t as many programming languages as it&rsquo;s worth learning for years. Especially for a good old man, it seems that the number of programming languages that might be worth learning is less than half the number of years.</p>
<p>I learned Java 23 years ago (when JDK 1.0 came out) How many languages have I learned so far?
In my case, if I enumerate the ones I wrote the code for and remember the name:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-.py" data-lang=".py"><span style="color:#f92672">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> A<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Basic,Z80,6809,C,C++,Object-Pascal,Java,Ruby,Perl,Scala,R,Go,Haskel,F#,Kotlin,Swift,Objective-C,Groovy,Python,Dart, Nim,Elm,Julia&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>split(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;,&#34;</span>)
<span style="color:#f92672">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> len(A)
twenty three
</code></pre></div><p>Becomes It&rsquo;s only 23 that you can remember. There should be a few more, so it&rsquo;s more than half the number of years. The i386 assembler was frustrated. Oh, I was also writing JavaScript. ..</p>
<p>By the way, nowadays when SEO of programming school is effective, I can see as many stories as &ldquo;programming languages to learn first&rdquo;, but I don&rsquo;t see &ldquo;programming languages to learn at the end of life&rdquo; very much (context such as blur prevention. I&rsquo;ve seen it before).
So, I would like to write &ldquo;My programming language to learn at the end of my life&rdquo;, which I should write.</p>
<p>We are all dead in the long run (Keynes). So, it may be helpful for those who have learned a few programming languages (&hellip; I wonder?).</p>
<p>When I say the latter half of my life or the last, I remember hearing about a seminar on pension economics that the diversity of the elderly is far greater than that of the baby. Since each person&rsquo;s life may have adult circumstances, the programming language to learn at the end of life is probably different for each person.</p>
<h1 id="language-programming-language-to-learn-at-the-end-of-life-in-my-case-with-three-lines">&ldquo;Language programming language to learn at the end of life&rdquo;, in my case with three lines.</h1>
<ul>
<li>I need to make tens of millions of yen more in my old age, but I don&rsquo;t want to lower my hourly price.</li>
<li>Even if you are over the age of 60, it seems that the unit cost per hour is good for professional managers or newcomer programming education.</li>
<li>When it comes to Java, Java seems to be presbyopious, so I&rsquo;d like to make Groovy3.0, which is almost compatible, a programming language to learn at the end of my life.</li>
</ul>
<p>To the end, the thoughts as of the end of 2019.</p>
<h2 id="note-lifetime-salary-300-million-yen-i-want-to-catch-up-with-the-club-and-learn-another-language">(Note) Lifetime salary 300 million yen I want to catch up with the club and learn another language.</h2>
<p>Well, I want to write code, earn some money, invest some money, and reach old age.
It requires tens of millions of yen after working until retirement.</p>
<p>So, how much money can I earn by writing code as a member of society? Let&rsquo;s write a little about that.</p>
<p>The following reference material is a &ldquo;lifetime salary &ldquo;Tokyo top 500 companies&rdquo; latest ranking&rdquo;.
<a href="https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/313934?page=5">https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/313934?page=5</a>
Among the companies that you may know, the IT companies that are estimated to have a lifetime salary of just 300 million yen are among the companies that you might know. Glittering cyber agents, Rakuten is often the subject of English official language.
Even if I worked for such a company from new graduate to retirement age, I could get 300 million yen as a full-time employee&rsquo;s salary (&hellip; there are very few such people). If I convert it with a freelance engineer, I think it would be good if I could earn 400 million yen, which is 1+1/3 times that amount, in my lifetime.
Since I&rsquo;m not a new graduate in the first place and have broken in a black workplace on the way, even if I catch up in the second half, it will be about 250 million yen as a full-time employee. In other words, where you want tens of millions of yen later.</p>
<h1 id="why-isnt-language-x-the-last-thing-you-learn-in-your-life">Why isn&rsquo;t Language X the last thing you learn in your life?</h1>
<h2 id="is-rust-the-last-thing-to-learn-in-life">Is rust the last thing to learn in life?</h2>
<p>I will probably end my adult life by continuing to write scala.
When learning a JVM language like Scala, sometimes I&rsquo;m envious of languages that can be natively compiled.
Especially modern rust looks good.
&hellip;But I feel something different when an old man writes rust, which is a lower language, in a rigorous work.
(Of course, it would be cool if there was such an old man)
So in my case, I rejected it because of my age.
Oh, I think young people can earn money by doing rust properly ~</p>
<h2 id="is-elm-the-last-thing-to-learn-in-life">Is elm the last thing to learn in life?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s the opposite of rust, and I&rsquo;m quite attracted to the front-end language elm in the standing position.
(For those who like elm, read <a href="https://qiita.com/arowM/items/5ec5853298fc880353b7">here</a>first.)
Since it is specialized for the web front end, the description is simple, but on the other hand, it is possible to write naturally with type safety.
Elm is great because I feel like I can put a code with security even in the year when dementia approaches.
Unfortunately, in the case of me, who is vulnerable to UX, I could not see the future of earning tens of millions of yen with elm after retirement.
If you are younger than the front end, you will definitely be happy if you do elm properly.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-i-learn-at-the-end-of-my-life">What should I learn at the end of my life?</h2>
<p>There could be other things such as dart that regained its presence with flutter, and Go that became the practical language of microservices can be used in practice.
I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s for the elderly, so I rejected it.
I also felt that it was lonely to have Haskell to prevent bokeh, so I dismiss it.</p>
<p>#Why are you thinking of learning groovy3.x at the end of your life?</p>
<p>Well, it is groovy3. I think few people are paying attention.
After all, groovy&rsquo;s history as Alt-Java is longer than other JVM languages, so groovy itself is not much talked about anymore.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that what is crucially different from other JVM languages such as Scala/Kotlin is the scripting language of ruby-bar, but its notational compatibility with Java.
In this area, you should read the introduction article of NTT Technocross, who is using groovy in practice.
<a href="https://www.ntt-tx.co.jp/column/tec/java_01/">https://www.ntt-tx.co.jp/column/tec/java_01/</a>
(&hellip;In other words, in the case of developing firmly with a Spring-based framework,
It has the implication that it is easy to make proposals such as using groovy together to increase development productivity. )</p>
<p>Although it is such an old groovy, Groovy 3.0 that corresponds to the evolution of Java itself since Java 8 is about to be released. &hellip;Because of the large language specifications of Java itself, but it has been around for quite some time.
<a href="http://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html">http://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html</a></p>
<p>By the way, if you use SDKMAN in Java version control, you can try Groovy3.0 rc immediately.</p>
<pre><code>$ sdk list groovy

==== BROADCAST ============================================== ====================
* 2019-12-08: Groovy 3.0.0-rc-2 released on SDKMAN! #groovylang
* 2019-12-06: Springboot 2.2.2.RELEASE released on SDKMAN! #springboot
* 2019-12-06: Springboot 2.1.11.RELEASE released on SDKMAN! #springboot
</code></pre><p>In short, if you learn groovy3.0, you can catch up with modern Java.
A person who has learned Java, ruby, and scala, should he relearn groovy that combines them?
It&rsquo;s unbearable, it&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>However, such a brilliant choice is one that takes aging into consideration.
People forget. And then gradually it gets out of focus.
In order for such an old man not to become a fossil, it should be known only 10 or 20 years ago of Java, which is useful as an educational language (I wrote android Java the last time, so 10 years ago in Java. There is only Java6 equivalent practical knowledge).</p>
<p>However, even though I&rsquo;m not working anymore, I don&rsquo;t really like Java8. Even with such an old man, I wonder if groovy3, which can be enjoyed as a scripting language, can enjoy learning so much.</p>
<p>Well, suppose that each person has their own thoughts about the end of their life (or rather, the last language they learn is not a programming language?)
In my case, Cospa also selects the programming language to learn at the end of my life, which is groovy3. For those who can&rsquo;t touch modern Java on business, I think it&rsquo;s a good idea to learn groovy3 a little on weekends because it doesn&rsquo;t have to be the end of life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll write my groovy3 learning notes after the official release of groovy3.</p>
<h1 id="finally-at-the-end-of-life-write-down-the-sense-of-mission-to-learn-programming-languages">Finally. At the end of life, write down the sense of mission to learn programming languages.</h1>
<p>Lastly, just write about why you want to learn a programming language at the end of your life (if you only earn tens of millions of dollars, there are other options).
That&rsquo;s because I want to give young people who write programs the inspiration of object-oriented languages as soon as possible. To put it in an easy-to-understand way, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B073GSDBGT/ref=dp-Iwouldliketoconveythelevelclosetokindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">&ldquo;Practical system design principles in the field-Practical techniques of object-orientation that make changes easy and safe&rdquo;</a> at SIer&rsquo;s new employee education. I don&rsquo;t want to see the youth who burns away in the field of water fall development without object-orientation and is swept away by a flood.
Now, I would like to learn a little about domain-driven design and make a small contribution to society.</p>
<p>So, your life is different.
Whether you are an old man or not, let&rsquo;s think about the programming language that we will learn next year and the programming language that we will learn at the end of life during the year-end and New Year holidays.</p>
<p>Poem time is over♪</p>
<hr>
<p>&hellip;Oh, I was also planning to write about graalVM and nim1.0, but since it was work time, I was out of time. &hellip;A story for the game industry, not the SIer world.I&rsquo;ll write about graalVM later and post a link here. .. I think that graalvm that can use JVM assets is useful in a language like nim, which is a low-level but specialized in concise description.
By the way, graalvm was hard with python. ..
Actually, I&rsquo;m wondering if it&rsquo;s good to spend tens of millions of years in old age in the game &amp; esports industry, but in that case, the last thing to learn in life is graalvm and nim or alt-python. ;-)</p>
