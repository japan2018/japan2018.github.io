      <description># Article purpose #  The same Python introductory person as myself should understand the basic usage of lambda expression.
The other day, my senior asked me about the use of lambda expressions, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t use them very much and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t answer them well, so I investigated and summarized them. At that time, I referred to the following sites. Or rather, this article is for organizing my thoughts, so I think it is easier to see the linked article.</description>

      <description>We are promoting the output activity of Qiita articles in-house. It&#39;s G-awa. The learning method using output is highly recommended and is highly recommended. However, on the other hand, it is difficult for one person to continue alone, so it is important for the team and organization to support each other. If you are alone, you tend to break your heart.  &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b_wxsoyflcs/WZP38JpI0LI/AAAAABGDA/troMJOw1KGUpq7yueRTgIdPc85o_kexXQCLcBGAs/s400/tamashii_nukeru_man.png&amp;rdquo; →=&amp;quot;30%&amp;ldquo;&amp;gt; →=&amp;quot;30%&amp;ldquo;&amp;gt; //2.bp.blogspot.com/-aIs9YKfGlEk/Vy2v2rXYgjI/AAAAAAAA6b0/PuaALahZfJsIluEeFOKgfgOy43qrc8bBQCLcB/s450/enjin_circle_wakamono.png&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;40%&amp;ldquo;&amp;gt;
I read yesterday&amp;rsquo;s article and it was very helpful :thumbsup: It&amp;rsquo;s a great environment for engineers to grow when there is an environment in which they can encourage each other.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ll do Hands Lab Advent Calendar this year as well  Overview We use Workspaces, a service that provides virtual desktops for AWS, Sometimes it’s unhealthy
\ Broken without doing anything /
Most of the time, it is possible to manage by restarting due to a temporary load drop. So there is Lambda that restarts for the time being It&amp;rsquo;s written in Node.js, so it supports frequent version upgrades&amp;hellip;
It&amp;rsquo;s simple code, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d rewrite it to python anyway</description>
