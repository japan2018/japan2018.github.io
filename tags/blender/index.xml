      <description># 0. What makes me happy about this article   You can see the flow of printing the data generated by deep learning on a 3D printer (10. In the experimental code, I have posted it to GitHub for all the codes **. The same thing can be done if you make an environment by git clone It should be easy.I wrote in herehowtocreatetheenvironment.) It becomes a study of material mechanics (I am writing while studying&amp;hellip;) Learn how TensorFlow 2.</description>

      <description># To write the continuation three years later...   Introduction to blender python script_01  I have had the opportunity to touch Blender&amp;rsquo;s Python console three years ago, and for the first time in three years, so I&amp;rsquo;ll write more.
Blender version Blender 2.8.1a: It looks like there have been major UI and API changes.
Debug environment on Blender The layout is as follows.
I have placed a Python Editor in the lower right of the Text Editor in the lower left of the figure display.</description>

      <description>This is the 23rd day article of [Blender Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/blender).  When creating Blender scripts and add-ons, you will often edit the source code using a text editor. One of the advantages of using a text editor is the efficiency of development by the code completion function, but as part of the Python API provided by Blender is provided as binary data instead of Python source code, it remains as is.</description>

      <description>Using Blender, I created a script that extracts only the vertex coordinates from the FBX data and arranges it, so I will introduce it after explanation.  Blender data structure First of all, about this figure (initial state) that you are familiar with.
By the way, the 3D view of Blender is managed as follows.
In Python script
bpy.context.scene.collection It is a place to hit.
This is the GUI here.</description>

      <description>** * Blender version is 2.80 **  Certain modeling in Blender can be catastrophically reduced in time using Python scripts. The task of arranging a large number of objects is the most important. I will give an example.
Arrange simple shapes ▽ Arrange primitives (simple figures).
Split the window and press Shift+F11 with the cursor on one side, as shown below.
Press &amp;ldquo;New&amp;rdquo; to create a new script.
Copy and paste the following text.</description>

      <description>Oh Python! Guys, are you modeling well today?  I tried to run Blender with a Python script and was suffering from a mysterious error. As a result of struggling hard, I found that the cause was ** API specification change **. It can be considered that most of the code currently published on the net (for 2.77 or earlier) does not work just by copying and copying.
↑ So, regarding the code that is currently released, if you do this here, it will work even with 2.</description>
