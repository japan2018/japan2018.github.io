      <description># Purpose of this article and target audience  This article provides a guide to those who have barely studied statistics before being able to speak brilliantly about Young&amp;rsquo;s statistics in the now known Bayesian stats.
The goal of this article is to be able to tell correct things about Bayesian statistics with a doya face, and to be able to argue with people who are familiar with statistics.
Please note that studying this article will not make you familiar with Bayesian statistics.</description>
