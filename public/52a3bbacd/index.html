<pre><code>## at first
</code></pre>
<p>This article aims to <strong>&ldquo;be able to develop services with Python from no programming experience&rdquo;</strong>,
We have arranged the skills to be learned as a learning roadmap.</p>
<p>** 2-3 hours every day (+2 hours on Saturdays and Sundays) ** If you continue, it will be completed in a minimum of 3 months.
You can skip the skills you have already learned and proceed.</p>
<p>The outline is the same for other languages such as <strong>Ruby</strong>.
It is okay if you read the part that says Python as Ruby.</p>
<p>*Information regarding programming is also posted on Twitter.
If you like, I would be happy if you could follow <a href="https://twitter.com/Koji21825331">Twitter account &ldquo;Saku731&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-learning-roadmap">Overview of learning roadmap</h2>
<p>First, there are 10 types of skills required for service development.</p>
<p>In each chapter, while explaining what each skill is useful for,
We will introduce reference articles and books that will help you acquire sufficient skills.</p>

<h2 id="learning-methods-and-reference-links">Learning methods and reference links</h2>
<h3 id="-building-a-programming-environment">① Building a programming environment</h3>
<p>First, do the <strong>&ldquo;environment construction&rdquo;</strong> required for programming.

</ul>
<h3 id="-how-to-make-a-website">② How to make a website</h3>
<p>If you are new to programming, we recommend starting with HTML first.</p>
<p><strong>The various websites that we usually see are &ldquo;always using HTML&rdquo;</strong>
The reason is that you can comfortably learn because you can make a few mistakes.</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML: Create a framework for a website

</ul>
<h3 id="-design-bootstrap">③ Design (Bootstrap)</h3>
<p>As you get used to HTML/CSS, you will feel ** &ldquo;I want to make a more beautiful website&rdquo; **.</p>
<p>With a great deal of experience, it is possible to make beautiful designs with CSS,
Everyone is studying to <strong>&ldquo;make a service&rdquo;</strong>, so move forward as early as possible.</p>
<p>A useful tool that appears there is <strong>Bootstrap</strong> developed by Twitter.
**It is a great thing to make a stylish site without CSS skills or design experience.</p>
<p>There are various versions,
Use the latest <strong>Bootstrap 4</strong> as of February 2020.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="-python-basics">④ Python basics</h3>
<p>Since I was used to programming, Python is finally here.
Even if you say Python in a word, there are various elements that you cannot learn enough.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this article, we focus only on <strong>service development</strong>,
<strong>Introducing the essential skills to use even if you hate it</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dot-blog.jp/news/python-object-type/">Get acquainted with various data types</a>
-int type (integer)
-float type (number including decimal)
-str type (string)
-list type (list)
-dict type (dictionary)</li>
<li>Get used to the control syntax

-<a href="https://www.sejuku.net/blog/28182">Class</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-database">⑤ Database</h3>
<p>Next is a database (hereafter DB) that is indispensable for service development.</p>
<p>If you use <strong>Web application framework &ldquo;Django&rdquo;</strong>, which will be introduced later,
You don&rsquo;t need to know the DB language such as MySQL.</p>
<p>That said, <strong>how is DB internally processing</strong>?
If you do not understand the concrete image, you will definitely have a hard time in the service development stage.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s focus on the minimum elements and study efficiently.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/SQL-%E7%AC%AC2%E7%89%88-%E3%82%BC%E3%83%AD%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E3%81%AF%E3%81%98%E3%82%81%E3%82%8B%E3%83%87%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%83%99%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E6%93%8D%E4%BD%9C-%E3%83%9F%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF-ebook/dp/B01HD5VWWO/ref=zg_bs_712806_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=W5ABD22S47XTVNK56N71">Reference books</a>
-Understand the basic processing (CRUD processing) of DB
-Understand the concept of foreign keys</li>
<li><a href="https://it-koala.com/entity-relationship-diagram-1897">Understanding how to write ER diagrams (DB blueprints)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-construction-of-development-environment-virtual-environment">⑥ Construction of development environment (virtual environment)</h3>
<p>If you clear up to this point, you will have the basics to start service development.
But don&rsquo;t be impatient, understanding the concept and usage of <strong>virtual environment</strong> will help you later.</p>
<p>I would like to confirm the details in the reference article, but
The purpose is to prevent the programming environment from cluttering **.</p>
<ul>
<li>Need for virtual environment

</ul>
<h3 id="-understand-the-procedure-for-web-application-development">⑦ Understand the procedure for Web application development</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s finally get into service development.
Please note that it is officially called <strong>Web Application Development</strong>.
*Hereafter referred to as &ldquo;Web application development&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In most web application development, <strong>&ldquo;Web application framework&rdquo;</strong> is used.</p>
<p>The web application framework can be roughly described as follows.
<strong>It is prepared with &ldquo;most of the parts required for development are completed&rdquo;</strong> It is okay to think that it is a convenient development auxiliary tool.</p>
<p>However, just coding the &ldquo;final superficial part&rdquo;** can be quite laborious.
This is the most difficult place, so let&rsquo;s do our best.</p>
<p>There are two popular web application frameworks in Python.</p>
<p>Although it depends on your preference of study method,
There are cases where you made it with Flask but remake it with Django.
I recommend <strong>challenge Django from the beginning</strong>.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s Django, I have an original Qiita article, so
It is organized so that you can learn the necessary elements in the shortest time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Difference between Django and Flask
-<strong>Django</strong>:
-There are many things to remember first. Difficult as an introduction
-There are so many optional features that you can&rsquo;t let go of it once you learn it
-<strong>Flask</strong>:
-Less to learn, relatively easy to develop
-Because there are few options, on the contrary, it is difficult for full-scale development
-In practice, you are often asked for Django</li>
<li><a href="https://qiita.com/Saku731/items/ed64190a12a4498b9446">Articles that can become people who can develop systems with Python (Django)_Introduction</a>
-Understand the whole picture of web application development
-Actually code the web app</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="requirement-definition-system-design">⑧Requirement definition-system design</h3>
<p>Next is the <strong>Requirement definition-system design</strong>, which is often overlooked.</p>
<p>No matter how much you can program,
**&lsquo;What should I make? ] If I can&rsquo;t decide **, nothing can start.</p>
<p>I will introduce the articles I wrote in the past, so
<strong>Be sure to master the &ldquo;Process of drawing a blueprint from an idea&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://qiita.com/Saku731/items/741fcf0f40dd989ee4f8">Requirements definition-Articles that can become people who can design systems</a>
-Requirements definition process
-Screen design
-Functional design
-Data design</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-source-code-management-github">⑨ Source code management (GitHub)</h3>
<p>If you study up to this point, various source codes will accumulate.
It is a time when managing even the most discerning person becomes troublesome.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Where did you save that program?&quot;</strong>
** &ldquo;I have overwritten. I want to return to the previous state.&rdquo; **
** &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hassle to share the program with other people (Zip it and attach it to e-mail etc.)&rdquo; **<strong>GitHub</strong> is a tool that solves these problems.
Be sure to learn it as it will be used in practice.</p>

<li><a href="https://backlog.com/en/git-tutorial/">How to use GitHub</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-service-release">⑩ Service release</h3>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s publish the developed service.
There are 5 types of <strong>preparations for publishing services (server preparation)</strong>.</p>
<p>In this article, we will introduce the specific procedure for ** &ldquo;⑤: Cloud server&rdquo; **.
*Except for the financial industry, ⑤ is preferred in practice.</p>
<p>Also, to use a cloud server
You need to master <strong>Linux commands</strong>, so learn them as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://knowledge.sakura.ad.jp/7938/">Characteristics of various server services/meridime</a>
-① Buy the server yourself
-② Rent a rental server
-③ Borrow VPS
-④ Rent a dedicated server
-⑤ Rent a cloud server</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/jp/register-flow/">Create AWS account</a></li>
<li><a href="https://qiita.com/tachibanayu24/items/b8d73cdfd4cbd42c5b1d">Service disclosure using AWS (EC2)</a>
-Contract with AWS
-Rent a server
-Publish service</li>
<li>Get used to Linux commands

-<a href="https://parashuto.com/rriver/tools/mac-command-line-basics">Reference article ②</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="at-the-end">at the end</h2>
<p>Creating a service by yourself requires a wide variety of skills.
It&rsquo;s a little difficult, but I&rsquo;ve seen many people actually overcome them.</p>
<p>Recently, an environment has been set up to make programming easier,
**Partial skills such as &ldquo;I am good only here&rdquo; are becoming more difficult to obtain a good job.</p>
<p>Once you get over it, it will be <strong>&ldquo;a powerful skill that can not be defeated by anyone else&rdquo;</strong>,
We hope that everyone who read this article will survive the three months.</p>
<p>Please do not give up until the end and do your best to create a good service.</p>
<p><strong>【P.S.】</strong>
Last but not least, we also post programming information on Twitter.
