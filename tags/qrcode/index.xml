      <description>## I went to a cleaning shop  The other day, I went to a laundry shop in the neighborhood to take out my clothes under the instructions of my wife.
Saturday after the new year.
Probably the day when most customers will come.
However, there is one aunt in the part.
Customers come in.
Well, right.
And behind the scenes to deal with customers. .. I wonder if there&amp;rsquo;s a phone ringing.</description>

      <description>I went to issue (reissue) a commuter pass for commuting at the beginning of the year.  Great queue. .. ..
What is this? Disneyland-like.
I write the same thing every time. Line up. Troublesome.
This means that if you issue a QR code once and hold each with your smartphone, you can improve efficiency considerably. ?
First, install the module for creating QR code with pip.
$ pip install qrcode After that, I asked for attribute information at the first time and made a QR code.</description>
