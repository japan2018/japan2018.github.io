<pre><code># Overview
</code></pre>
<p>Write what you are learning every day as an elderly person.
I am inspired by how younger generations are eager to learn technology. Since the front and Web systems are too various to be able to keep up with learning, I specialize in the fields of my interest.</p>
<p>By the way, there is no organization theory or anything like that.</p>
<h1 id="self-introduction">Self-introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li>Soon to be 50 years old (looks like &ldquo;is that right?&rdquo;, but can&rsquo;t beat the presbyopia)</li>
<li>In the past, the foundation, for some reason now the business team, the business core in general.</li>
<li>A while back, LPIC, Java, Oracle</li>
<li>Recently, statistics and Python are the main (but not related to business at all)</li>
<li>We plan to work on a data analysis competition in the near future (let&rsquo;s do it together)</li>
</ul>
<p>We repeatedly propose statistical tests and in-house education (learning support) for Python. I hope you can pick it up soon.

<h1 id="looking-back-over-the-past-year">Looking back over the past year</h1>
<p>The theme is machine learning/deep learning, but I want to be able to create something by myself instead of just using something. I think there are four major things that I need to think about.</p>
<p>I tend to read and implement it because I am mainly self-taught, but I am still lacking in understanding. I also try to take a qualification test to improve my skill.
(I can recommend it if there is a learning support from the company, but this area is &ldquo;selfish&rdquo;.)</p>
<h2 id="1-improvement-of-basic-ability-based-on-mathematics">1. Improvement of basic ability based on mathematics</h2>
<p>As a hobby, I also did mathematics, so there is no problem with &ldquo;differential, partial differential, algebraic&rdquo; which is necessary for machine learning and deep learning. I have had memories of avoiding mathematical statistics because they were &ldquo;unpleasant and uncomfortable&rdquo;, but I learned again by myself. A few years ago, I acquired the qualifications of the statistical test second grade and the statistical expert researcher. Currently, I am studying for the first grade of statistical test.
<a href="http://www.toukei-kentei.jp/">http://www.toukei-kentei.jp/</a></p>
<p>Exercises are so important that I not only read but move my hands to solve problems. It is impossible when commuting to work, so before work or at home. Currently, I am solving without setting the time, but I want to be able to solve a huge amount in a short time considering the &ldquo;practice&rdquo;. You can see by taking the test, but I don&rsquo;t have much time at all, that is, the people who do their core business do this amount. .. ..</p>

<p>##2.python implementation
The theme is understanding the language specifications and the amount of implementation.</p>
<p>There were not many cases at the company, so I taught myself. Since it is not enough to read it somehow, I learned the basic skills through the sutra and qualification test. However, if you pass this qualification test, it is not a substitute for free data analysis, it is still insufficient.</p>

<p>Other than that, I refer to the website of Gachi group.
At this stage, you can appreciate the value of learning by using &ldquo;Hoji Pata&rdquo; and &ldquo;Basics of Modern Mathematical Statistics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>##3. Algorithm design
Writing/moving, this does not mean OK. Even in machine learning, which requires a large amount of computation, efficient algorithm training is required, and it is also necessary to increase the number of algorithms that can be understood and used. Of course, theory and inspiration are needed.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive programming contest site &ldquo;At Coder&rdquo;</strong>
<a href="https://atcoder.jp/?lang=ja">https://atcoder.jp/?lang=ja</a>
It is held every Saturday, and there is a printed page for the problem text, so I carry the output and carry out training with a little time to spare. .. ..</p>
<p>##4. +Î± in business
Shortly before I was transferred to the business team, &ldquo;automatic maintenance of the infrastructure&rdquo; and &ldquo;cloud usage&rdquo; were talked about, and it was a time when cost reduction and error reduction by not involving people were proposed. It was certainly when I started learning that I had some thoughts.</p>
<p>I wonder if the business team had more CI initiatives than the basic team. .. .. There is no big difference&hellip; Of course there was CI by maven + jenkins, but it was up to partial automation.</p>
<p>So when I started automating at all, it was hard to return to manual work management with Excel and management ledger, so various management / manual work was automatically executed using Python and Jenkins (scheduled in the middle of the night and in the morning Are all done).</p>
<p>I think that I have practiced Python in the course of this improvement task. There is a sense of achievement when Jenkins will do all of the tasks that are just around the corner. Looking back, I wrote a good number of small tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>numpy</li>
<li>Graph creation</li>
<li>Data editing</li>
<li>Handling of Excel in python</li>
<li>Python and Redmine integration</li>
<li>Cooperation with OS</li>
<li>Integration with Postgres</li>
<li>Easy to trip problem solving know-how</li>
<li>Text editing cooperation with bash (awk/sed/find/grep)</li>
<li>Regular expressions</li>
</ul>
<p>And the &ldquo;excel excel macro&rdquo; has also been realized. I swear I will never write a macro again.
(The macro occupies the terminal with a high load and a long time when a person doesn&rsquo;t start.</p>
<p>By going from manual work to Jenkins, I think that it is possible to generate time and to have the extra power to do things Î±, which leads to a good cycle. These days, when I discover some kind of problem in development and operation, I think it&rsquo;s almost like making countermeasures on the day and starting operation without human intervention. Since I sometimes make it in a rush, I have some rough code, and I plan to do refactoring as well.</p>
<p>**It&rsquo;s a state where you have made &ldquo;Independent RPA&rdquo; with Python and Jenkins. .. .. **</p>
<p>Since this is an external site, it may be a problem to describe the internal circumstances in detail, so please contact us individually if you are interested.</p>
<p>#from now on</p>
<p>We are still in the middle of the road, but I think we are finally ready for the data competition. It was a year of detours, but I am hoping for a stage where the basic skills that I have refined somewhere will come into play.</p>
<p>next year
I would like to expand my ability to participate in data analysis competitions and Gachi seminars. If you have specialized in learning while you were a student, let&rsquo;s do it together.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">https://www.kaggle.com/</a>
<a href="https://signate.jp/competitions!%5BIMG_20191220_195728.jpg%5D(https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/107149/40544f90-fda4-29cc-f27f-bdf0fdd70f09.jpeg)">https://signate.jp/competitions![IMG_20191220_195728.jpg](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/107149/40544f90-fda4-29cc-f27f-bdf0fdd70f09.jpeg)</a></p>
<p><strong>Recent Interests</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Days when I feel that I can&rsquo;t easily talk about relationships without causal reasoning.</li>
<li>Where the business team is, but want more concrete analysis themes. .. .. Then I learned from Saber Metrics as a hobby. There seems to be a hint to create a characteristic index.</li>
<li>I changed my home environment from notebook to vscode. Progress (notebook default support). By the way, at the company, it is vimer (use it without using any plugin).</li>
<li>Participation in bicycles and brevets (200km, 400km)</li>
</ul>
