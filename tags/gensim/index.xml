      <description>#Introduction  I have summarized what I have learned about Word2Vec, which is now a standard method for natural language processing. The outline of the algorithm is organized and the model is created using the library.
##reference I have referred to the following to understand Word2Vec.

      <description>In this article, we&#39;ll look at how to use fastText to get a distributed word representation. [Article on the previous day](https://qiita.com/BlueRayi/items/eb7949594839771c1b70) I thought it would be nice if I could talk about a little link.  What is #fastText
