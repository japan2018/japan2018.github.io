      <title>[Python] [Patent Analysis] I made a patent map in Python without spending money</title>

      <description>#Introduction  I thought it would be a good idea to do a patent analysis, so I decided to give it a try. Specifically, for patent analysis, for example, there is the following plot. (The figure is quoted from J-STORE Manual) The vertical axis shows the patent applicant, the horizontal axis shows the year the patent was issued, and the size of the circle shows the number of patents. This is called the bubble chart.</description>

      <title>[Python] Scraping with Tor in Python</title>
      <link>https://memotut.com/81f4b893b/</link>

      <description>## Note  :warning: This article does not recommend scraping with Tor.
Scraping is basically okay, but if you are prohibited by the terms of use of the target site or if you put an excessive load on the server of the target site, you may be punished.
What is Tor It is a technology that anonymizes the connection route. Theoretically, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to determine who accessed using Tor.
Execution environment Homebrew 2.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m doing Atcoder (competitive programming) as a hobby, but I&#39;ve been slowing down recently.  I think it would be nice to automate the test work during the contest, I made a test automation tool with python.
Introduction Below are more features than the homebrew tools introduced in this article.
 https://github.com/kyuridenamida/atcoder-tools https://github.com/nodchip/OnlineJudgeHelper  Please compare the above when using.
1. What has been achieved  Automatically get test cases from Atcoder problem page without overloading the server Build and grade the created code (c++) before submitting, and judge AC, WA, TLE, etc.</description>

      <description>We are promoting the output activity of Qiita articles in-house. It&#39;s G-awa. The learning method using output is highly recommended and is highly recommended. However, on the other hand, it is difficult for one person to continue alone, so it is important for the team and organization to support each other. If you are alone, you tend to break your heart.  &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b_wxsoyflcs/WZP38JpI0LI/AAAAABGDA/troMJOw1KGUpq7yueRTgIdPc85o_kexXQCLcBGAs/s400/tamashii_nukeru_man.png&amp;rdquo; →=&amp;quot;30%&amp;ldquo;&amp;gt; →=&amp;quot;30%&amp;ldquo;&amp;gt; //2.bp.blogspot.com/-aIs9YKfGlEk/Vy2v2rXYgjI/AAAAAAAA6b0/PuaALahZfJsIluEeFOKgfgOy43qrc8bBQCLcB/s450/enjin_circle_wakamono.png&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;40%&amp;ldquo;&amp;gt;

      <description># Overview  A student majoring in information systems at a certain T university. While looking at various articles of Qiita, I found such an article.
 If you have deep learning, you can exceed 100% recovery rate in horse racing  Regarding the 100% recovery rate in this article, it is unclear whether it will be valid in other periods because the number of betting tickets that were simulated for purchase is small.</description>
