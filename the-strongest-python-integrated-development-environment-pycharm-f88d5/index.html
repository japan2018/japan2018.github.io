<pre><code># Strongest Python integrated development environment PyCharm
</code></pre>
<p>When learning a new language, a good IDE will be the best teacher, so I think it should be used actively without being stingy.
So, let&rsquo;s take a look at PyCharm, the most powerful integrated development environment in Python.
I think it is the most, so I wrote it assuming Web application development with Django.</p>
<p>The data on functions and price system are as of PyCharm 5.0.2 on December 15, 2015.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/</a></p>
<p>PyCharm is a Python IDE from Czech JetBrains s.r.o., famous for its high-quality IDE.
Works with Widows / OS X / Linux.</p>
<p>JetBrains IDE is based on a Java IDE called IntelliJ IDEA.
PyCharm is developed as its Python plugin.
We also develop IDEs such as Ruby, PHP, JS, C++, Objective-C/Swift.</p>
<p>PyCharm also comes with Web development related plugins such as JS, CSS, and HTML, so front-end development can be done in the same environment.</p>
<h2 id="price">Price</h2>
<p>There is a paid Professional Edition and a free Community Edition.
Community Edition has the same analysis mechanism of Python itself, but the plugins related to Web development and
It should be noted that support for WebApplicationFramework, support for DB, SQL, etc. are omitted.</p>
<p>If you want to do web development, you should use Professional Edition.</p>
<p>There is a 30-day free trial so please try it first.</p>
<h2 id="price-system">Price system</h2>
<p>JetBrains products are offered on a monthly/annual subscription basis.
The price is highest in the first year and gradually decreases as it continues, and the amount is the same from the third year onward.</p>
<p>If you go to the purchase page, there are two plans, PyCharm only plan and All Products Pack including all other IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.
If you are developing iOS apps or use Ruby, PHP, Java, C++, etc., the All Products Pack may be worth your consideration.</p>
<p>PyCharm comes with Web-related features, so you don&rsquo;t have to buy WebStorm separately if you just want to write client-side code.</p>
<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/</a>
If you go to Nikkei, you can download the image that suits your platform.
Then just install as instructed. The OS X version now also ships with Java, so it will continue to work.</p>
<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/95821a88-0e1f-96a9-131c-68595ca5855a.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 21.16.45.png"></p>
<p>PyCharm manages codes and settings in units of Project.
It is also possible to create a project from the start screen, load existing code, and fetch from VCS such as git.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we will introduce the recommended features for project settings.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/d7e965a6-a352-eb52-51ec-7046c3959bf3.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 21.19.11.png"></p>
<h3 id="virtualenv-management">virtualenv management</h3>
<p>In Python, the environment is often divided by virtualenv, so create and set the virtualenv environment for Porject that was created.
You can specify an existing virtualenv environment or create a new one when creating a project or by going to Preferences -&gt; Project -&gt; Project Interpreter.
A list of installed libraries and the latest version are also available, so it is also convenient for batch checking of library updates.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/1fcc5544-232b-5fc7-efab-0b7a8c0125d7.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 21.25.47.png"></p>
<h3 id="raise-pep8-warning-to-warning">raise PEP8 warning to warning</h3>
<p>The warning level for PEP8 violation, which is the Python standard coding standard, is low, so it is better to raise it to a warning.
There is no merit to violate PEP8 because I feel nauseous while watching the code that violates PEP8.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s raise week warning to warning from Preferences -&gt; Editor -&gt; Pythons in Inspections -&gt; PEP8 coding style violation.
The naming conversion violation level below that should be raised as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/dc5a5ad9-dd37-be26-45de-d6a1663dae40.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 21.25.29.png"></p>
<h3 id="change-check-of-file-encoding-description">Change check of file encoding description</h3>
<p>Python will follow the rules at the beginning of the code if the file encoding is something other than ascii. Add the following for its description style and checking.
Python -&gt; File contains non-ASCII character in Preferences -&gt; Editor -&gt; Inspections and Encoding comment format as you like.
Since it is necessary even if there is Japanese in the comment part, it is good to put it in all files by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/799c5774-ac60-df8a-d6d5-1813beb4d15e.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 21.25.25.png"></p>
<h3 id="project-structure">Project Structure</h3>
<p>You can add a reference path route such as a search path, template, or image.
If you can&rsquo;t get out with code completion or jump to Template, check it.</p>
<h3 id="django-setting">Django Setting</h3>
<p>When using Django, specify the position of settings and the position of the root as a Django project.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/98797256-10fd-3fca-ee22-ec2ba81e8191.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 21.26.28.png"></p>
<h3 id="docstring-format">Docstring format</h3>
<p>The format used by Docstring.
It works well when using type hinting with comments.
There is no problem if you select reStructuredText.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/8750a84f-ccba-783f-bc0c-11c458e60830.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 22.37.51.png"></p>
<h3 id="template-language">Template Language</h3>
<p>Besides Django, it also supports Jinja2, Mako, Chameleon, etc.
Let&rsquo;s specify the Template language to use.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/6baca1e8-bc3c-1d22-5050-038519587399.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 21.34.55.png"></p>
<h3 id="vcs">VCS</h3>
<p>Supports VCS such as Git, Mercurial, Subversion, etc.
If set, changes etc. can be confirmed from the editor, and partial restoration is also supported.</p>
<p>Even if the git submodule or outside of Project is the root of VCS, it will recognize that you add the setting here.</p>
<h3 id="line-number-display-blank-character-display">Line number display, blank character display,</h3>
<p>It can be found in Preferences -&gt; Editor -&gt; General -&gt; Appearance.
In general, PyCharm&rsquo;s search is very good, so if you put it in the search box in the upper left, it will display nicely.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/de85db07-afa8-c421-001e-07fac44f7be1.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 21.46.43.png"></p>
<h3 id="file-template">File template</h3>
<p>You can specify the template when creating a new file.
Preferences -&gt; Editor -&gt; File and Code Templates.</p>
<p>When using Python2.x, it is good to add the following two items.</p>
<p>Absolute_import will be confused by relative reference if the rule at the time of import is Python 2.x, so let&rsquo;s make it absolute reference only.
If you want to make a relative reference, you can explicitly describe it, and it is preferable to add it so that you do not have to worry about it. This is the same as the default behavior of Python3.x.</p>
<p>unicode_literals makes the default string type unicode.
It&rsquo;s a long time to explain, but it&rsquo;s better if you let Python3.x work, because it doesn&rsquo;t cause confusion.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python:" data-lang="python:">from __future__ import absolute_import
from __future__ import unicode_literals
</code></pre><p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/3c648d6d-4117-4bbf-4029-0bf67682679c.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 21.25.35.png"></p>
<h3 id="when-writing-code-to-support-multiple-versions-of-python">(when writing code to support multiple versions of Python)</h3>
<p>You can select multiple versions to check in Python -&gt; Code compatibility inspection in Preferences -&gt; Editor -&gt; Inspections.
It is effective in library development.When writing code that runs on 2.x series, it is better to write code that matches 3.4 or above as much as possible.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/83dcdf72-4be9-95f8-1b54-be5a4aedebf3.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 21.25.18.png"></p>
<h1 id="function-introduction">Function introduction</h1>
<h2 id="search-everywhere">Search everywhere</h2>
<p>This is the search bar that appears when you press Shift twice.
It will incrementally search most things related to Project such as file names, symbols and actions.
Method names and file names will be searched by ignoring case delimiters such as upper and lower case letters and underscores, so it&rsquo;s nice to remember.
I think there are quite a lot of PyCharm users who rely on this.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/00276d5f-affd-e1b5-c666-16526af13c01.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 22.06.36.png"></p>
<h2 id="code-analysis">Code analysis</h2>
<p>You can jump to the definition with Cmd + click or shortcut.
It will even look inside the library so you can feel free to read if you have any doubts about the behavior or arguments.
Even if the target can not be specified by meta operation etc., it will display the candidate and code reading will be much easier.</p>
<p>In ToolWindow Project or Structure, you can set the linkage with the specified editor.
You can specify the operation by selecting the following with the gear mark in the upper right. (Icon in Structure)</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Auto Scroll to code </dt>
  <dd>Display the file (line) selected in ToolWindow on the editor side</dd>
  <dt>Auto Scroll from code</dt>
  <dd>Display the file (line) displayed in the editor with ToolWindow</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can set it to your liking.
By the way, the path of the file currently in focus appears at the top of the editor, so you can refer to the file in the middle directory.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/1a962fe6-db44-689d-1eec-0a908fb219ad.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 22.18.13.png"></p>
<h2 id="code-completion">Code completion</h2>
<p>General code completion does everything possible.
Moreover, it works with the same logic as Search everywhere, so I&rsquo;m happy that it complements the latter half of the method name.
To be honest, this is pretty strong.</p>
<p>Also, since it works without importing, if you remember the class name or function name, you can write it for the time being and select a candidate with Alt + Enter and add an import statement automatically.</p>
<p>The menu that comes out of Alt + Enter at the warning is full</p>
<ul>
<li>Conversion of double quotation and single quotation etc.</li>
<li>The automatic addition system gives various candidates according to the context. The following is an example.
-import
-Function/class/argument definition
-Library installation
-docstring
-test</li>
<li>Change of expression format. tuple -&gt; list and {} -&gt; dict()</li>
</ul>
<p>etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/179ca0b9-9b24-5a08-ae3b-6eece8961d1c.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 22.13.53.png"></p>
<h2 id="typehinting">TypeHinting</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a type hint that was recently introduced with Python3.5.
PyCharm has a TypeHinting function with comments for several years, and you can perform code completion and refactoring with TypeHinting even if it is not Python3.5.</p>
<p>If type information is lost due to meta operations etc., if you add it with TypeHinting, completion will be effective and argument errors etc will be found, so let&rsquo;s use it aggressively.
I can&rsquo;t finish talking about TypeHinting, so let&rsquo;s leave it to another article. The Syntax of TypeHinting that can be used in PyCharm is summarized below. ‥</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/help/type-hinting-in-pycharm.html">https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/help/type-hinting-in-pycharm.html</a></p>
<h2 id="database-integration">Database integration</h2>
<p>You can connect to RDB such as MySQL and view/manipulate data from GUI.
I&rsquo;m mainly using SequelPro, so I&rsquo;m not using it much, but I think it&rsquo;s useful if you&rsquo;re not using ORM.</p>
<h2 id="djangosql-alchemy-support">Django/SQL Alchemy support</h2>
<p>Supports Django/SQL Alchemy ORM completion.
These internal implementations have many meta operations, and it is difficult to complete just by analyzing static code, but it is possible to jump to completion and definition.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/4ec4ab40-6753-272d-1c81-d364f6f69da9.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 22.42.38.png"></p>
<h2 id="template--html--js">Template &amp; HTML &amp; JS</h2>
<p>You can move from View to Template seamlessly, and complete HTML/CSS/JS completion.
It also properly analyzes dependencies between Templates and paths such as images.</p>
<p>It also supports TypeScript and CoffeeScript, so PyCharm is very useful even for clients who do not write server side.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/2b6cb4c7-b39e-b2fe-619a-d9df47069d40.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 22.03.47.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/14510/77fa6277-0eec-81b0-8f0d-053183e5f2d3.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-15 22.04.00.png"></p>
<h2 id="debugger">Debugger</h2>
<p>PyCharm comes with a debugger, and you can do almost anything you can with a typical debugger, such as stepping, setting breakpoints, stopping and changing variables, and Watch.
This debugger is also caught in Template. Of course you can step.
The stack trace in the Template is hard to see, so it&rsquo;s quite appreciated for complicated Templates.</p>
<h2 id="remote-debugger">Remote debugger</h2>
<p>You can ssh it and run it in a remote server environment with a debugger.
It is quite effective for investigating environment-specific problems.</p>
<h1 id="other">Other</h1>
<p>There are too many functions to write, but the accuracy of code analysis and completion is quite good, and the fact that it has all the functions from the beginning and does not require environment construction is a major reason why we recommend PyCharm.
Searching, replacing, and automatic refactoring will work pretty fast once the indexing is done on the first project load, and they all work together in a stress-free manner.</p>
<p>I often take out only a part of the function and substitute it, I see a comparison of only the function list, but in the development environment, I think that it is most important that the code analysis area to use most and the search work fast and comfortably ..
In that respect, PyCharm will give you a memorable experience.</p>
