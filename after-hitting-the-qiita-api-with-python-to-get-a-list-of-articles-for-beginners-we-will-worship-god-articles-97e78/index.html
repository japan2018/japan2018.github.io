<pre><code>## Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>Qiita&rsquo;s &ldquo;Beginner&rdquo; tag and &ldquo;New Programmer Support&rdquo; tag articles for beginners
As a new QA engineer, everything is very helpful.
Unfortunately, the individual tag page only shows trends and new articles,
The specifications make it difficult to find good articles in the past.
In this article, first use the Qiita API to write an article for beginners (:= Article with the tag &ldquo;Beginner&rdquo; OR &ldquo;Newcomer programmer support&rdquo;)
After creating a program to output all, next read each article in the output list in descending order of likes
I would like to introduce the God articles that I felt &ldquo;This is really helpful!&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Note: This time I&rsquo;m filtering by number of likes, but articles for you are God articles regardless of how many you like!!</em></p>
<h3 id="thing-you-want-to-do">Thing you want to do</h3>
<ol>
<li>Get all the articles for beginners and output to CSV</li>
<li>Read CSV with spreadsheet software and sort the list in descending order of &ldquo;likes most&rdquo;</li>
<li>Visit from the top</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="make-a-program">Make a program</h2>
<h3 id="consider-how-you-can-get-all-the-articles-for-beginners-and-output-to-csv">Consider how you can get all the articles for beginners and output to CSV</h3>
<p>I thought about it simply like this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get all articles with &ldquo;Beginner&rdquo; tag OR &ldquo;New programmer support&rdquo; tag with API</li>
<li>Extract only the data you need</li>
<li>Export the data to CSV</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="read-api-specifications-and-consider-how-to-acquire-data-and-required-data">Read API specifications and consider how to acquire data and required data</h3>
<p>If you read <a href="https://qiita.com/api/v2/docs#%E6%8A%95%E7%A8%BF">official document of Qiita API</a>, you will find the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Articles can be retrieved by throwing a search query containing the number of pages and tags in &ldquo;GET /api/v2/items&rdquo;</li>
<li>The total number of elements (number of articles) is included in the Total-Count response header
<ul>
<li>You can get all articles by first throwing a search query to get the article number and converting it to the page number</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the purpose of this time, the following data of each acquired article is enough
<ul>
<li>title</li>
<li>url</li>
<li>tags
-There is a case where you can not understand the contents at first glance with only the title, so as supplementary information</li>
<li>updated_at
-It is necessary to check whether the specifications have been changed for technical information that is too old</li>
<li>likes_count
-Due to the large number of articles, for screening</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implement-a-bit">Implement a bit</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Yaboxi/PyQiitaSearch">I have put the code implemented based on the above examination, its explanation, and sample output file on GitHub. </a></strong></p>
<p>In implementing, I have referred to the following article. Thank you!
<a href="https://qiita.com/kumarstack55/items/73119fe8b6e43fd4b21f">Get a list of articles I posted on Qiita</a></p>
<h2 id="visit">visit</h2>
<p>You can operate the list with Python, but since it is troublesome, I will read CSV with spreadsheet software and edit it this time.
Add a header column appropriately and sort it in descending order in good order. After that, I will go around the URL from the top.
In my case, I liked the articles I liked and colored them on the table.</p>
<p>As of November 20, 2019, the total number of articles acquired is 8642!
I couldn&rsquo;t read the whole thing, so
This time, I read 75 articles that had earned more than 1000 likes as of November 20, 2019.</p>
<h2 id="carefully-selected-super-god-article-list">Carefully selected! Super God article list</h2>
<p>Below is a list of 22 super-god articles that I was particularly impressed with, which loaded 75 god articles!
(Although it is a little too much, I still carefully selected duplicate contents etc.)
The content is roughly divided into categories.</p>

<p>At the same time, I&rsquo;m not satisfied just by reading the article, but I should actually take action.
It&rsquo;s going to be a long road, but I can&rsquo;t help but hurry up, so I&rsquo;ll do my best&hellip;!</p>
