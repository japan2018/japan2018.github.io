<p>#Coding interview and leetcode</p>
<p>Foreign IT companies place great importance on coding interviews when hiring software engineers.
It&rsquo;s more like a programming contest problem, which is easier than business coding, and it seems common sense that American students and engineers take a few months of proactive measures when they receive an IT company.
Regarding the general interview process, I am familiar with a book called &ldquo;A book to train programming skills to fight in the world&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B071GN3JN2),">https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B071GN3JN2),</a> but it usually takes time to get an offer as a software engineer. A 45 to 60 minute coding interview will take about 3 to 5 sessions.</p>
<p>In the past few years, a past interview site called <a href="http://leetcode.com">leetcode.com</a> has been widely used by candidates.
About 2018, I heard from students at Columbia University that almost all computer science students have accounts and half of them are charged.
At the time of interview, it is common to let candidates promise not to leak out the problems that came out, but leetcode collects the problems that are likely to have been raised by large companies and conducts a billing business, so it is morally gray. ..
Since the leaked problem becomes difficult to use, it seems that the cat-and-mouse game of &ldquo;Twist the problem -&gt; Leakage&rdquo; is occurring, and it seems that the coding interview itself has become somewhat difficult in recent years.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, leetcode-based interview preparation is extremely useful for engineers who are not professional computer demons or genius programmers.
There are aspects of the skills required for an interview that are difficult to train even if you do leetcode casually, so I think that it is possible to proceed with the interview advantageously by preparing for it.</p>
<p>Below, we discuss what kind of preparation should be made by calculating backwards from the intention of the hiring side.</p>
<p>#Recruiter&rsquo;s intention</p>
<p>Coding interviews formally look like a process computer, but they&rsquo;re not just &ldquo;tests&rdquo; that compete for the right answer to the question.
The interviewer is trying to determine if the candidate will be able to work with him as an engineer, and mainly to see if the candidate has the following capabilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ability to produce results on its own
-1a. Understand complex logic and be able to code it accurately and fast
-1b. Know in detail the nature of the main algorithms and data structures, and make optimal choices during implementation
-1c. Appropriate software design is possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to develop well within the organization
-2a. Write code that is easy to read and maintain
-2b. Accurate and bidirectional information exchange can be performed face-to-face.
-2c. Take a positive and supportive attitude and consult with others to find better solutions</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on this, concrete measures will be described.</p>
<p>Pre-training using # leetcode</p>
<p>Billing leetcode unlocks some additional features.
In particular, the frequency of questions given by the entire industry and by company is valuable, and it is advantageous to charge if you spend a certain amount of time preparing for the interview (the moral decision to pay for leetcode is by each person).</p>
<p>Although classicalized high-frequency problems tend to be avoided on the question side, it is good to solve them in order of frequency because there is a good chance that similar problems will occur and many are worth learning in a good question.
If the company to receive is decided, it is better to proceed both the frequency order of the company and the overall frequency order (both overlap to some extent).
If you accept the top companies, it is better to do about 200 questions if time allows.</p>
<p>The interview lasts about 45 to 60 minutes and the standard is (easy or medium) + (medium or hard).
Since we will have a discussion after solving the problem, it seems that the actual time that can be used to solve the problem will be 15-20 minutes for medium and 30 minutes for hard.
The speed at which problems are solved is important, so familiarize yourself with writing algorithm code quickly.</p>
<p>Some hard problems are fairly difficult for ordinary people to solve at first glance (<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/cat-and-mouse/)">https://leetcode.com/problems/cat-and-mouse/)</a>.
Though the way of thinking depends on the interviewer, it seems that he is trying to see the ability (2b, 2c) to discuss with the hint premise rather than the sharpness of the head (1a) which can be solved with no hint when an extremely difficult problem occurs.
So when practicing, you don&rsquo;t have to think about unsolvable problems for a long time, and if you can solve it in an hour at the longest, you should look at the explanations and the codes of others.</p>
<p>Even if you can solve it, be sure to see the explanation and the code of others.
In the interview, after solving the problem, we ask the spatial and time complexity and discuss the trade-off with possible alternative solutions (1b), so it is worth touching multiple solution methods.
Other people&rsquo;s codes are often helpful in compact writing.</p>
<p>Unlike the online judge function of leetcode, you cannot execute the code in the interview, so after writing the code, make a habit of debugging without using the computer by manually executing the test case while making a note of the value of the variable.
When I noticed the edge case myself, the impression in the interview was very good.</p>
<p>Many interviewers say &ldquo;fine grammar doesn&rsquo;t matter&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s obviously better to be able to write accurate code without stagnation.
Since the interviewer is also a human being, it is possible to be unknowingly influenced by impressions other than the point that the interviewer intends to evaluate.
First of all, practice from easy to write the code and be Accepted in one shot.
Therefore, it is best to remember the grammar of the language to be used and the standard library related to algorithms as accurately as possible (described later).</p>
<p>Since you have to write easy-to-read code in the interview (2a), solve the problem while being aware that common logic usually becomes difficult to function, and nests such as for and if are not too deep.</p>
<p>In order to keep the solution method in mind, it is better to repeat the problem that could not be solved at intervals of 1-3 months.
I think it depends on the person, but even if I concentrate on it for 2-3 months, my skill does not improve suddenly, so it is recommended to practice little by little over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Pre-training other than #leetcode</p>
<h2 id="programming-language">programming language</h2>
<p>Python is the recommended language for coding interviews.
This is advantageous because the amount of typing is small, the frequently used algorithms are almost in the standard library, and the interviewer can often read them. In fact, the majority of candidates use Python.
Any other language that you are familiar with is fine, but a language with a weak standard library for algorithms and a language with a large amount of typing (C++/Java) are somewhat disadvantageous.</p>
<p>Be familiar with the standard library of grammars and algorithms for your language so that you can write accurate and idiomatic code.
In Python, it is good to remember defaultdict, OrderedDict, Counter, deque, bisect, heap, map/reduce, comprehension notation, lambda expression (useful for writing sort key), with notation as much as possible. ..
Keep in mind that with leetcode, reading and writing files, concurrency (threading and locking), and random number generation that are rarely written on the interface may be suddenly heard during an interview.
If you can afford it, learn the itertools accumulate, chain, product, permutations, combinations, etc. to write the code concisely.</p>
<h2 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h2>
<p>Learn the basic algorithm and the amount of calculation.
The first volume of the textbook <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4621085107">Algorithm Design Manual</a>isrecommended(thesecondvolumeisunnecessarybecauseitisanencyclopediaofadvancedalgorithms).</p>
<p>Basic algorithms that you can implement from scratch and explain the computational complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find, add, delete operations for unsorted array, sorted array, unidirectional/bidirectional linked list, hash table</li>
<li>Find and add operations for non-equilibrium binary search tree (path is because delete is complicated)</li>
<li>Heap push, peek, pop(bubble up, bubble down)</li>
<li>Stack and queue</li>
<li>Notation to rewrite function recursive call using explicit stack</li>
<li>Insert sort, bubble sort, quick sort, merge sort (to be able to answer why quick sort/merge sort is O(NlogN) time)</li>
<li>(Addition) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect">quickselect</a>:Median(ork-thlargestelement) of unsorted columns is calculated in linear time</li>
<li>Naive string search</li>
<li>Naive trie</li>
<li>Binary search</li>
<li>Graph DFS/BFS</li>
<li>Dijkstra method, prim&rsquo;s algorithm (complexity order changes when using priority queue)</li>
<li>Dynamic programming (use edit distance of character string as an example)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you write recursive algorithms such as binary search, quick sort, DFS/BFS, etc., you will make mistakes immediately and you will end up with an infinite loop.
Whether recursion can be written correctly is important as a checkpoint for coding skills.</p>
<p>An algorithm that does not have to be implemented by itself but should be able to explain the outline and answer the calculation amount:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hash table collision countermeasure (open address vs chain)</li>
<li>Implementation of balanced binary search tree</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort">timsort</a>:WhenusingPython,concatenatingtwosortedarraysandsorting()willsortinO(N) time.</li>
<li>Heap initialization (to be able to answer why O(N) time)</li>
<li>Kruskal algorithm (union-find), Floyd-Warshall, Bellman-Ford</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="system-design-interview">System design interview</h2>
<p>Most major companies usually have a system design interview for one panel.
The higher the job level, the larger the system and the abstract problem setting, and the ability to find problems and the ability to design are required.</p>
<p>System design interviews are less systematic than coding interviews, and it is more difficult to take proactive measures because it is subjective how the interviewer decides what is good or bad.
It is advisable to simulate in advance the problems that may arise from your work history and the position to which you are applying.
This material costs money halfway through but is very useful: <a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview">https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview</a></p>
<h2 id="other-cs-basics">Other CS basics</h2>
<p>If you are not a so-called computer science graduate, it&rsquo;s best to keep your education as high as you can.
It&rsquo;s okay if you don&rsquo;t know the basics at all, but there are many engineers other than those from the CS system, so there is no need to give up.</p>
<p>It is better (2b/2c) to honestly say that if you do not know it, it will be counterproductive to talk with a baking blade when appealing developmental content.</p>
<p>Required-Minimum knowledge of computer systems such as TCP/IP (If you are not confident, you can use the book &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4822283151">Why programs work</a>&quot;).Abookcalled&quot;MinnanoComputerScience&rdquo;(<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4798154814)%22seemstobeagoodwaytocheckthelackofbasicknowledge">https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4798154814)&quot;seemstobeagoodwaytocheckthelackofbasicknowledge</a>.)</p>
<p>nice to have</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer architecture</li>
<li>OS</li>
<li>Compiler (some knowledge about parsers is beneficial)</li>
<li>Numerical calculation</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Computational theory</li>
<li>Probability statistics and machine learning</li>
<li>etc. etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="english">English</h2>
<p>Generally, the demand level is not high.
Basic communication is enough, but if you don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re saying at all, you&rsquo;re more likely to fall.</p>
<p>If you watch your favorite content with netflix in English subtitles for about 200 hours, you will be able to talk about the atmosphere.</p>
<p>#Preparation</p>
<p>Check the description environment at the time of the interview as much as possible.
Is the keyboard layout familiar if a type machine is rented out on a whiteboard, editor, or onsite interview?</p>
<p>If the production is whiteboard coding, be sure to practice writing the code on the whiteboard.
Even if you can use the editor, practice without the automatic indentation function in leetcode.</p>
<p>#Interview production</p>
<h2 id="coding-interview">Coding interview</h2>
<p>Note that if you start writing code silently for the problem, even if the solution is correct, it will be a big goal.
Keep in mind that the reason people interview rather than the online judge is their broader communication (2a, 2b, 2c).</p>
<p>First ask the time frame and how many problems you intend to raise, and manage the time yourself.</p>
<p>Problems are often intentionally vague, so when you hear a problem, ask a few questions to confirm the specifications.
Frequently asked questions such as input/output format, data size assumption, value range assumption, edge case (empty container, divide by zero, graph self-loop, etc.), possibility of multiple solutions, etc.
In leetcode, all the incidental conditions are written in the question sentence, but be aware that you are expected to ask yourself in the actual interview.
The possibility of numerical overflow, etc., may be finally ignored and coded, but it is a good impression to mention once.</p>
<p>When you think of an approach, say it as loudly as possible.
If the interview is in English and the candidate is not familiar with English, it will be tough, but if it is tough, practice a little beforehand.
If possible, use an environment where a whiteboard can be used.
The interview is not an English test, so any means is acceptable as long as you can communicate.
It is also good to prepare a blank sheet and a thick pen when writing a telephone interview during a video conference, and write it on a large sheet of paper to explain.</p>
<p>If you get stuck with your thoughts, tell them how you got stuck and talk to the interviewer.
Especially when the problem is difficult, there is a high possibility that it is required to find a solution while consulting, rather than solving without a hint.
It&rsquo;s bad impression if you throw it to the interviewer like &ldquo;give me a hint&rdquo;, but consultation styles such as &ldquo;I think xx but what do you think?&rdquo; and specific questions can be rather positive.
If you have knowledge that you can&rsquo;t remember, ask a quick question rather than shut up silently.</p>
<p>Before we start writing the code, we briefly explain the possible approaches (preferably multiple) and explain the trade-off between computational complexity and implementation complexity.
Check with your interviewer before you start writing about your approach.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the readability of the code.
You can assume features that aren&rsquo;t in the standard library, but be sure to communicate their specifications.</p>
<p>After writing, do a manual test with an example.
At this time, the interviewer&rsquo;s reaction may give hints.
Even if the interviewer is aware of the bug, the interviewer does not want to point it out directly, as it will reduce the possibility that the candidate will notice and fix it.
There is a possibility that the code is incorrect when there is subtle silence or when you are prompted to &ldquo;test it&rdquo; or &ldquo;explain the behavior&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="action-interview">Action interview</h2>
<p>Large companies often ask questions about leadership and interpersonal relationships, citing past experiences and hypothetical situations.
It should be noted that even if you get a very good technical evaluation, it basically drops if you consider it as a red flag in terms of behavior.</p>
<p>The recruiter basically thinks that &ldquo;I want someone who can make the right value judgment and move voluntarily and take the leadership actively, but it is troublesome for people who disturb the teamwork too much or demoralize the surroundings&rdquo;. There is.
Depending on the corporate culture, people who are aggressive towards others are strongly wary of foreign capital (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=brilliant+jerks">brilliant jerks</a>). Therefore, in the interview, balance the leadership appeal and the cooperative appeal.</p>
<p>When asked about the motivation for changing jobs, avoid saying bad things about your previous job and say a positive reason.
It is dangerous to be regarded as a person who blames others for the cause of failure.
Note that foreign capital is the same as Japanese companies in this area.</p>
<h1 id="addendum">Addendum</h1>
<p>In the interview, luck factors such as compatibility with the interviewer (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=interview+anti-loop&amp;oq=interview+anti-loop">interview anti-loop</a>) cannot be avoided. ..
There are always ways to fall that seem unreasonable, and it is very painful to prepare and fall a lot, but failing is not always due to lack of ability.</p>
<p>If you do not have an interview with a company of the same type, you should avoid receiving your first choice first and try to gain experience with multiple companies if possible.</p>
