<pre><code># Why do you do drone business?
</code></pre>
<p>MTG Forest contributes to the fields of forestry and agriculture through machine learning.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<ul>
<li>Measure the degree of fruit growth with image authentication</li>
<li>Identify the name of the animal</li>
<li>Measure the number of trees in the mountain</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve been doing this with Python if I say it in a programming language.
We also use machine learning, object recognition, and AI functions.</p>
<p>And this time we will start a new business to develop this technology using drones.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-in-the-drone-business">What to do in the drone business</h2>
<img width="748" alt=" Screenshot 2020-05-06 17.37.35.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/529156/a62ee691-4392-4391-2dfc-ce829b39f2f6.png">
<ul>
<li>Human resource development (Mokumoku meeting held)</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s play with a drone</li>
<li>Useable knowledge and technology</li>
</ul>
<p>I mainly think about this.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s go over each one in detail.</p>
<h2 id="human-resource-development">Human resource development</h2>
<p>Here, I will explain how to develop human resources.</p>
<p>First of all, it is said that there are fewer Pyhon engineers in Japan than in the world.</p>
<p>The programming language itself called Python has been around for more than 10 years, but there are still few engineers in Japan.</p>
<p>For those who are studying programming now, Python, machine learning, and AI are good!
The future of AI!</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of this?
I think there are also many people who are interested in Python and machine learning.</p>
<p>However, in reality, there are few jobs that use such technology.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think this is really weird?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that this technology will make humanity richer.
And what will happen to the future as the times change? I think some people are looking forward to it.</p>
<p>However, it is not popular in Japan.</p>
<p>It is wierd, is not it?</p>
<p>I think of the cause in this way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Small number of engineers</li>
<li>Large amount of existing work</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, I want to incorporate new technologies such as Pyhon and machine learning!
Isn&rsquo;t it possible for us to improve our business performance by incorporating it into our company?</p>
<p>Even if you think that there are companies, I think that there are many companies that can not actually be introduced due to the number of engineers and the state of the company.</p>
<p>Since 2020, programming education has become a compulsory subject.</p>
<p>Because of this, I would like to provide an environment where I can learn programming using a drone as an environment where I can enjoy learning continuously.</p>
<h2 id="mokumoku-meeting">Mokumoku Meeting</h2>
<img width="532" alt=" Screenshot 2020-05-06 17.34.27.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/529156/00b28bcf-84ae-c8fc-19e4-1b26727b6bea.png">
<p>Here, we will hold a main mocking session on coding using Python and drones.</p>
<p>By the way</p>
<p>Students study for exams at the family restaurant</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s gather like this and study! And so on.</p>
<p>In our case, let&rsquo;s study together and fly the drone! It&rsquo;s a place like that.</p>
<p>At the Mokumoku Meeting, which I aim for, I aim to be a Mokumoku Meeting where everyone can respect each other regardless of age, experience, or gender.</p>
<p>By doing so, I think we can help each other.</p>
<p>And when we fly a drone, we want to share our emotions.</p>
<p>And the purpose of holding Mokumoku Meeting</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing an environment where you can continue to learn programming</li>
<li>Can cooperate for the express purpose of flying a drone</li>
<li>We can develop human resources necessary for the coming era</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to offer Mokumokukai as a place like this.</p>
<h2 id="play-with-a-drone">Play with a drone!</h2>
<img width="509" alt="Screenshot 2020-05-06 17.43.29.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/529156/6aa94ee0-97f7-7673-6049-6dbdceef0892.png">
<p>The first thing I wanted to do when I decided to learn programming was to write the program myself and fly the drone.</p>
<p>However, at that time there was no such a blessed environment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I was thinking this way.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t fly a drone even if you buy it and code it, you won&rsquo;t continue to study even if you buy it!</p>
<p>I think many people think the same way as I do.</p>
<p>But there are mountains in MTG Forest owned by MTG Forest.</p>
<p>And there is more than enough space to fly the drone.
There is no problem if you fly about 10 people at a time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about an hour from Nagoya city, so you can fly a drone without worrying about the surrounding eyes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are various fruits, so can the fruits be correctly confirmed by image authentication? You can also check your own program such as.</p>
<p>We want this place to look like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t just play, check the result of flying the drone properly</li>
<li>Identify reflection points</li>
<li>Improve</li>
</ul>
<p>How about that?</p>
<p>And learning programming is not easy.
There are many difficult things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just follow the code</li>
<li>Need to study long time alone</li>
<li>Losing purpose of studying due to busy schedule</li>
</ul>
<p>What are you studying for?</p>
<p>No matter how many engineers you need, it&rsquo;s not easy to study.</p>
<p>Even if you actually start studying, I think it&rsquo;s difficult to continue without having fun.</p>
<p>However, at MTG Forest you can learn programming in such an environment!</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn machine learning and programming with drones!</li>
<li>You can ask people even if it is difficult</li>
<li>You can actually fly a drone</li>
<li>Discover new goals and issues from the results</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, the purpose of skipping drones from programming learning has become one.</p>
<p>And I think that following this roadmap will be a fun and continuous way to study.</p>

<h3 id="how-about-this-usage">How about this usage?</h3>
<p>Even so far, many have learned that you can enjoy programming with a drone.</p>
<p>I would also like to propose a usage like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Parents and children tackle summer vacation free study</li>
<li>Learn programming to change jobs</li>
<li>Play with the latest technology</li>
</ul>
<p>How about that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that if you use it in this way, it will be useful for you.</p>
<p>And here there is also a space where you can BBQ in the shade.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/529156/baabc827-e949-3738-a0a6-9902e8bd0fa0.jpeg" alt="IMG_1940.JPG"></p>
<p>You will surely be able to play with your family and friends all day long!</p>
<h2 id="to-useable-knowledge-and-technology">To useable knowledge and technology</h2>
<p>MTG Forest has already received requests from various companies and has provided technologies in accordance with the requests.
I would like to continue to grow into a company that can contribute to society by collaborating with other companies.</p>
<p>This machine learning genre can contribute to many people widely.</p>
<p>There may be innumerable things that can be done depending on the idea.</p>
<p>We do research not only to keep such ideas as simple ideas but also to develop practical knowledge and techniques.</p>
<p>By learning together, I think that even beginners can acquire the knowledge and skills that can be used.</p>
<p>Your idea may be realized by devising it.</p>
<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>
<p>We are also looking for engineers to work with us in developing the machine learning market.</p>
<p>I am also looking forward to contributing to many people through the drone business.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this far.</p>
<p>If you are interested, please contact me directly on Twitter or Facebook!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s spend a meaningful time studying while playing together!</p>
