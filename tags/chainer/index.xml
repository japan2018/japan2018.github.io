      <description>#Overview  Hello. A new employee of an IT company. Here, I described a sine wave prediction regression model learning program as a sample using Pytorch which is an open source machine learning library. (It&amp;rsquo;s not a time series forecast&amp;hellip; I also want to do a time series forecast.)
By moving chainer to pytorch, I was late, but I wrote it because I am trying to catch up this time. It also describes what I felt the difference.</description>

      <description>###Overview  It is full of feeling that face recognition is announced after the end of development of Chainer is announced, I will spell it here as a memorandum.
This series will be sent in two parts. This time, I will explain how to implement the learning phase (learning face images). Next time, I will explain the implementation of prediction phase(facerecognitionusingcamera).
Since I am a ML first-year student and a high school student at the time, some of the information may be incorrect or there may be a bug in the program.</description>
