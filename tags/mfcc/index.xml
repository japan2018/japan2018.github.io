      <description>In the [previous article](https://qiita.com/k-maru/items/4f12fd0f8344b9e093bd),vowelrecognitionwasperformedusingformantanalysis.IlearnedaboutMFCCinaninternshipat[CyceedCo.,Ltd.](http://www.sciseed.jp/), and verified the classification accuracy, so this article is a continuation of the previous article about MFCC that is often used for speech recognition. I would like to summarize.  ##table of contents
 Background What is MFCC -MFCC derivation process Implementation of MFCC derivation program -Regarding librosa -Derivation of MFCC -Phoneme class classification using MFCC Implementation of a program for continuous speech recognition -Regarding dynamic differences -Derivation of primary and secondary differences -Phoneme class classification including features of second-order differences Consideration Summary Reference  background Previous article formant analysis finds the envelope of the spectrum, and the frequencies emphasized in them are used as features from lower to F1 and F2.</description>
