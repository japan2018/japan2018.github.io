      <description># In a nutshell  Purchase a cheap gaming PC (Windows), Enable to switch CPU/GPU in virtual environment of Anaconda, Tensorflow-Running the GPU (v2.0) code, With 4 patterns including CPU/GPU of Colaboratory, I compared the performance. I will summarize the performance comparison results and the Windows version environment construction procedure. Article.
*I often hear that GPU is effective for machine learning
 Gaming PCs have GPUs and are cheap these days  ⇒ ** Let&amp;rsquo;s use GPU of gaming PC for machine learning!</description>

      <description>Hello. In my work, I&#39;m far from engineering and I can&#39;t write much by doing what I&#39;ve done,  I have a little time, so I&amp;rsquo;ll summarize what I learned a little. Advent calendar I&amp;rsquo;m not afraid! You can write an article that you just did a tutorial! That means one&amp;hellip;
Assumed readers I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a lot about machine learning, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched on implementation so much so I will touch on it.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  This series is described as a summary of learning of PyTorch which is a machine learning framework of Python. This time, I have written a summary of the basics of PyTorch. It may be difficult to read as a reading material because I try to write down the main points rather than to convey it, but I hope you can use it to understand the points.
What is #PyTorch As I mentioned earlier, PyTorch is a Python machine learning framework.</description>

      <description># Where is it  Here Please use it. Since it uses a GPU, the processing speed is quite fast. The best Google that lends GPU for free! !
#How to use
If you get an error, restart the runtime and run the cells one by one from the preparation section. I think most errors will be resolved by doing so. If you get a network error when downloading, please execute the cell again.</description>
