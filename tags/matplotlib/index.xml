      <description>#Introduction  The productivity and soundness of a software development team can be understood as an internal sensation, but it is difficult for an external person to see it. This information asymmetry has caused problems in relationships with people outside the development team.
Also, for EMs, CTOs that bundle multiple development teams and products, and visualizing each situation with objective numbers and graphs, it is important reference information when considering the overall strategy.</description>

      <description># 0. Introduction  This article is a general function of graph creation using matplotlib of python and its brief description. In order to increase the versatility, we have devised a method that corresponds to the increase in the legend, etc. with a repeating function as much as possible. Also, since pandas.dataframe, which is often used in data processing, is used, it is easy to use it as it is for data after calculation.</description>

      <description>## Overview  Even if you try to analyze the access log of Apache, Tomcat, etc., it is not a surprisingly good tool. I would like to have a tool that supports various output formats and that can filter only the necessary information and visualize it easily, but I can not find it easily.
So, I tried using Pandas and Matplotlib, which are standard in the world of data analysis, to analyze and visualize Apache access logs on Jupyter Notebook.</description>

      <description>#Continuing from the previous session  This article is an application of Python visualization tools. ~~ Since it has become long, I decided to divide the application into two. (Application 2 is still being written) ~~ The application section was added to this article to make it one. If you are new to Python plot, I wrote the basic version last time, so please check here! #Introduction I am currently a graduate student with a 2nd year master&amp;rsquo;s degree.</description>

#Introduction I am currently a graduate student with a 2nd year master&amp;rsquo;s degree. I am studying the Martian atmosphere using numerical simulation. Since I mainly analyzed the results obtained by numerical simulation using Python, I tried to summarize all the functions used in the process. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list. .. .. However, since I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling to use the documentation, I&amp;rsquo;ve summarized it in the hope that if anyone using Python&amp;rsquo;s visualization tools can help with that!</description>

      <description># Addition  This is an article that implements the Monte Carlo method. I forgot completely.
1.First of all When I was reading a book for children&amp;rsquo;s statistics [1], I saw an article about spreading rice grains to calculate the pi. It seemed interesting, so I tried to calculate the pi using the randomly generated x, y coordinate data.
[procedure] It&amp;rsquo;s almost like this

      <description>#Introduction  I thought it would be a good idea to do a patent analysis, so I decided to give it a try. Specifically, for patent analysis, for example, there is the following plot. (The figure is quoted from J-STORE Manual) The vertical axis shows the patent applicant, the horizontal axis shows the year the patent was issued, and the size of the circle shows the number of patents. This is called the bubble chart.</description>

      <description>## Introduction  What color do you use when drawing graphs with matplotlib? By default, matplotlib has a pretty colormap, I want to use different color variations for presentations, materials and graphs Have you ever wanted to unify the color images?
In this article, we will add the brand color image to the matplotlib colormap. I will try to adapt!

      <description># draw a stacked bar graph with matplotlib  Motivation When I draw a stacked bar chart in Python, I wish I could display the data label like Excel, and when I looked it up, there was no article that could display the data label, and there was no code to copy and paste. So, I wrote a code that I can copy and paste when I want to attach a data label to a stacked bar graph.</description>

Many people have summarized how to use matplotlib, so it may not be new, but I would appreciate it if you could associate.
I have summarized the usage of numpy and pandas in the previous article, so please check if you like.

      <description># at first  A library called Plotly Express (official site) that allows you to easily draw interactive operations based on javascript was released a while ago. I found. Since I felt a potential of a dimension that was clearly different from the static drawing that I have used so far, I have summarized the method of drawing a basic visualization method also as a memo. For reference, I am comparing it with the pattern that I wrote a similar figure in matplotlib+seaborn.</description>

      <description>[Adventar](http://www.adventar.org)[PythonAdventCalendar2015](http://www.adventar.org/calendars/846) This is the 21st day article.  When drawing a graph in Python, I think Matplotlibwillbeused.Recently,Seaborn is a library that cleans graphs, and I love it. However, when you want to select and set colors more freely, it is convenient to customize Colormap with +Î±. This time I will introduce this.
#Preparation
First is the usual set import. Most of them are in Anaconda, but the missing ones can be installed with pip install &amp;lt;your library name&amp;gt;.</description>
