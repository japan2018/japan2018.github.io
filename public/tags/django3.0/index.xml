      <description># Celebration! Django 3.0 released!  02/12/2019 Django 3.0 has been released. Django 1.0 was released in 2008 and 2.0 was released in December 2017. And 3.0 was released on 12/2 of this year. The upgrade from 1 to 2 took about 10 years, but from 2 to 3 it took less than 2 years, which is a surprising sense of speed. On the other hand, what have I been doing over the last two years?</description>

      <description>#Foreword  Django 3.0 was officially released 3 days ago. Release node link I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in the addition of ASGI support, among many changes, I want to actually use it. :sunny:
Note: What is ASGI?:briefcase: ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is the spiritual successor to WSGI and aims to provide a standard interface between asynchronous-enabled Python web servers, frameworks, and applications. While WSGI provided the standard for synchronous Python apps, ASGI provides both asynchronous and synchronous apps with a backwards-compatible implementation of WSGI and multiple servers and application frameworks.</description>
