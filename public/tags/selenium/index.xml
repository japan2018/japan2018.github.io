      <description># Did you make Python do boring stuff?  I didn&amp;rsquo;t let it do A book on the cover with a robot like this C-3PO playing grass
It&amp;rsquo;s well-known as a good Python book, and many people have read it.
So who read this book and did Python actually do the boring stuff? Isn&amp;rsquo;t it quite small? I think there are many people who are satisfied with reading. I was one of them.</description>

      <title>[Python] I want to sell a product that was exhibited by Mercari python scraping</title>

      <description>## Trigger  Do you sell anything you no longer need using Mercari? I also sell unnecessary books in Mercari, but since they are old reference books and study books, they are hard to sell. .. ..
Mercari will offer a &amp;ldquo;sellable price&amp;rdquo; when listing. However, if I set it to a high price, I can&amp;rsquo;t sell it, and if it&amp;rsquo;s too cheap, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve lost something.
Before setting the price of an exhibit, I conduct a search to find out what the real market price is.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  I&amp;rsquo;m a VTuber Marginal Geek. In December, &amp;ldquo;Virtual to Live&amp;rdquo; was held at Ryogoku Kokugikan, and it was also streamed live by Nico Nico. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even go to the field and even see them in real time, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait until the disk came out. That&amp;rsquo;s why I bought an online ticket and saw the time shift. Well, than expected. I wanted to save it until I could not see the time shift, so I started analyzing Nico Niko with Python.</description>

I would like to express such a situation.

      <description>When you build a machine learning system that uses Python, you can use data that can be used without restrictions on control mechanisms such as patents called open data that are open to the public on the Internet.  Of course, I use the acquired data to update the model efficiently, but there are times when I want to automate. This time, I will try to use Selenium with the so-called Web scraping.</description>

      <description>What is # [Selenium](https://selenium.dev/)  Selenium is a framework for automating web browser operations. Developed by ThoughtWorks in 2004 to automate UI testing of web applications. https://selenium.dev/history/
Originally developed for the purpose of UI testing and JavaScript testing of web applications, it is used for various purposes other than testing, such as task automation and website crawling.
This article describes the environment setup and basic usage for operating Chrome via Selenium in Python.</description>

      <description>Are you using Google Colaboratory? It&#39;s the best, isn&#39;t it?  Google Colaboratory is a Jupyter notebook environment that runs on a browser. Moreover, GPU and TPU machines can be used free of charge. That&amp;rsquo;s the best.
However, there were two rules about usage time (described later), and it was also a addictive point to crawl Colaboratory users.
&amp;ldquo;When I wake up in the morning, the connection will be cut&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;</description>

      <description># Overview  A student majoring in information systems at a certain T university. While looking at various articles of Qiita, I found such an article.
 If you have deep learning, you can exceed 100% recovery rate in horse racing  Regarding the 100% recovery rate in this article, it is unclear whether it will be valid in other periods because the number of betting tickets that were simulated for purchase is small.</description>

      <title>[Python] I made a module PyNanaco that can charge nanaco credit with python</title>
      <link>https://memotut.com/ff3c8283a/</link>

      <description># GitHub  PyNanaco
What is this  You can use selenium to access the nanaco web page and log in/out, credit charge, and set/cancel your credit card. Up to 50,000 yen can be credited with one command.  merit  50,000 yen can be charged in one operation, so it is easier than operating the web screen Work to set/release credit cards on multiple nanaco can be described in a few lines If linked with a separate cron or scheduler, nanaco charge and credit card settings can be changed by batch processing.</description>

      <description>I think that the biggest hurdle for beginners in programming is environment construction.  This time, the environment construction has been reduced as much as possible, And I chose a language with few meaningless descriptions. However, it has become long after all. This time we will move the chrome automatically.
What to download this time (I don&amp;rsquo;t install the huge software that seems to be written in a beginner book of a common program)</description>
