      <description>*Memo will be updated at any time*  Aiming to build a python development environment
In the environment I upgraded from Mojave to Catalina, when I did it normally, it did not work as expected with python3 or pip3 due to the difference in version, so I try using pyenv and see if it works.
It&amp;rsquo;s actually better to use Docker, but for now&amp;hellip;
homebrew Start from here.

      <description># What&#39;s this?  macbook Python environment
 pyenv poetry pipx  It&amp;rsquo;s a memo because it was built in. The environment is mac OS 10.14.6 Mojave. I will proceed with the assumption that homebrew is already included. (If you don&amp;rsquo;t have homebrew, please refer to Homebrew official) I will update it as appropriate.
#Install Python3 Install python3 of system with homebrew. If you have already put it in, please skip it.</description>

      <description>It is as this article that had been a hot topic before. â€¦Because it becomes a worthless article, I will explain it a little.  My Python Development Environment, 2020 Edition
The author of this article uses WSL, but I can use it almost as it is in OS X environment.
pyenv  Why? I need to run multiple Python versions, isolated from the system Python.pyenv makes it easy to install, manage, and switch between those multiple Pythons.</description>

      <description># Overview  This article is a step-by-step article on how a beginner himself developed a coupon distribution service for iPhone with RESTful API and swift. It was a very detouring implementation because we implemented it while examining the technical elements one by one.
Python is originally installed on the Mac, but the version is old as of OS 10.15. When actually writing Python, everyone seems to have been updated to 3 series.</description>

      <title>How to use tkinter in pyenv python</title>

      <description>## Issue  The following error occurs when you do python -m tkinter or import tkinter with python installed by pyenv. When I read the article on the net, it said that it was cured by brew install tcl-tk, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t work. However, apparently it seems that the recently released pyenv v1.2.14 fixes the compatibility with tcl-tk, and GitHub issue I also wrote a solution, so I will share it.</description>
