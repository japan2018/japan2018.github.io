<h2 id="purpose-of-writing-the-article">Purpose of writing the article</h2>
<p>The words AI and deep learning have been around for a long time, but I don&rsquo;t think there are many people who really understand their meaning.
I think it&rsquo;s very dangerous to have a debate about what AI can do, as in Japan today.</p>
<p>I think the reason why there is such a debate about AI in this way is that you do not fully understand the mathematical basis of machine learning.</p>
<p>As long as you understand the basic theory, you should be able to easily predict what AI can do and how it will progress in the future.</p>
<h2 id="target-audience--knowledge-that-you-should-have-to-learn-machine-learning">Target audience &amp; knowledge that you should have to learn machine learning</h2>
<p>This article is for anyone who often hears AI but doesn&rsquo;t really understand it.</p>
<p>Machine learning, especially deep learning, is fully understandable if you have a high school mathematics knowledge.
However, I think it&rsquo;s better to understand differentiation.</p>
<p>In addition, I think you should have some programming knowledge.
For the books and video materials that we will introduce from now on, the basic method of studying iron plate is to learn machine learning while moving hands through programming.</p>
<p>So, the summary of the knowledge level of this article is that &ldquo;you should be able to read programming, assuming almost no mathematical knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id="study-method">Study method</h1>
<h2 id="study-method-overview">Study method overview</h2>
<p>As a learning method for machine learning, we strongly recommend learning from deep learning.
In the world, deep learning seems to be treated like the boss of machine learning, but in terms of ease of understanding, that is not the case.</p>
<p>Certainly, with the advent of deep learning, the current AI boom has taken place.
However, among the many machine learning algorithms, the neural network that is the basis of deep learning is quite simple.</p>
<p>Deep Learning was revolutionary,</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase the number of calculations in the neural network (I am vaguely saying lol) (make it deep),</li>
<li>In addition to the neural network, with a little &ldquo;ingenuity&rdquo;,
It was an explosive precision.</li>
</ol>
<p>A little &ldquo;ingenuity&rdquo; of 2 is important in deep learning, but this &ldquo;ingenuity&rdquo; is different between (1) multidimensional data such as image recognition and (2) time series data such as natural language processing. I will.</p>
<p>If you can understand up to this point, you can say that you understand the basics of deep learning.</p>
<p>To study machine learning in general, it is enough to study deep learning.
First of all, if you can understand deep learning with a lasting sense, it seems like &ldquo;machine learning is easy&rdquo; lol
In addition, the future learning of machine learning is mainly trying to understand each algorithm and actually using it, so it may be unnecessary if you are not an engineer.</p>
<p>The following are the presentation materials for deep learning that I have announced at study sessions.
I hope you will take a look at the books and videos I will introduce in the future to deepen your understanding.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go!</p>
<h2 id="book--video-study-order">Book &amp; video study order</h2>
<h3 id="study-that-i-want-non-engineers-to-do">Study that I want non-engineers to do</h3>
<p>The first thing to read is</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%82%BC%E3%83%AD%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E4%BD%9C%E3%82%8BDeep-Learning-%E2%80%95Python%E3%81%A7%E5%AD%A6%E3%81%B6%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E3%83%A9%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8B%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%81%AE%E7%90%86%E8%AB%96%E3%81%A8%E5%AE%9F%E8%A3%85-%E6%96%8E%E8%97%A4-%E5%BA%B7%E6%AF%85/dp/4873117585/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_ja_JP=%E3%82%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A&amp;crid=3KK1Y2AGRRRY3&amp;keywords=deep+learning&amp;qid=1575984944&amp;sprefix=deep+lea%2Caps%2C393&amp;sr=8-1">Deep Learning from scratch-Theory and implementation of deep learning learned with Python</a>
is.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a must read for anyone who wants to understand deep learning even a little.
The evaluation is also very high.
The stance is to study while writing Python code, but I think it is enough if you understand the meaning.
This is a very easy-to-understand book about deep learning for image recognition.</p>
<p>You can understand the outline of neural networks, which is the basis of deep learning, and the technique of &ldquo;convolution,&rdquo; which is a device for image recognition.</p>
<p>If you just want to get a good idea of the basics of AI, I think it&rsquo;s enough to finish reading this article.
You can master the basics of deep learning with just one book.</p>
<p>After reading this book, or at the same time, on Udemy</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-scikit-learn/">Machine learning with Python: Introduction to identification with scikit-learn</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Look at <strong>half</strong> (laughs).</p>
<p>Actually, the instructor will explain it while moving the programming, so I think that the outline can be understood even if you are not a person who understands engineering in earnest.</p>
<p>This video explains exactly what &ldquo;machine learning is&rdquo;, so I think you can get an overview of machine learning by looking at this video while reading the above book.</p>
<p>And the point that I think this video is good as an auxiliary teaching material of the above book is that it properly explains the &ldquo;basic of neural network of the basic of deep learning&rdquo; called &ldquo;perceptron&rdquo;.
The explanation of the basic concept of &ldquo;loss function&rdquo; that appears at the same time is also excellent.</p>
<p>If you had a good understanding of this area, you could almost completely understand deep learning.</p>
<p>The next recommendation is the same author from the above book, from the same series.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%82%BC%E3%83%AD%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E4%BD%9C%E3%82%8BDeep-Learning-%E2%80%95%E8%87%AA%E7%84%B6%E8%A8%80%E8%AA%9E%E5%87%A6%E7%90%86%E7%B7%A8-%E6%96%8E%E8%97%A4-%E5%BA%B7%E6%AF%85/dp/4873118360/ref=sr_1_2?__mk_ja_JP=%E3%82%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A&amp;crid=3KK1Y2AGRRRY3&amp;keywords=deep+learning&amp;qid=1575984944&amp;sprefix=deep+lea%2Caps%2C393&amp;sr=8-2">Deep Learning from scratch ❷-Natural language processing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>is.
We write about the technology for AI to learn human language (natural language to be difficult).
If you&rsquo;re wondering how Google Translate and Alexa are getting smarter, you should take a quick read.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that most of the AI discussions in the world can be understood by understanding the contents of the two books, Image Recognition and Natural Language Processing.
You can also see who is saying tedious things on Twitter and news with a doggy face lol</p>
<h3 id="for-those-who-want-to-understand-basic-technology-as-an-engineer">For those who want to understand basic technology as an engineer</h3>
<p>From here onward is for engineers.
Let&rsquo;s move our hands a little and get an overview of each machine learning algorithm.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/Python%E3%81%A7%E3%81%AF%E3%81%98%E3%82%81%E3%82%8B%E6%A9%9F%E6%A2%B0%E5%AD%A6%E7%BF%92-%E2%80%95scikit-learn%E3%81%A7%E5%AD%A6%E3%81%B6%E7%89%B9%E5%BE%B4%E9%87%8F%E3%82%A8%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B8%E3%83%8B%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%81%A8%E6%A9%9F%E6%A2%B0%E5%AD%A6%E7%BF%92%E3%81%AE%E5%9F%BA%E7%A4%8E-Andreas-C-Muller/dp/4873117984/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_ja_JP=%E3%82%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A&amp;keywords=%E6%A9%9F%E6%A2%B0%E5%AD%A6%E7%BF%92&amp;qid=1575988094&amp;sr=8-1">Machine Learning Beginning with Python-Basics of Feature Engineering and Machine Learning Learned with scikit-learn</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a part that is covered with the previous video <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-scikit-learn/">Machine learning with Python: Identification introduction learned with scikit-learn</a>.
Conversely, if you look at this book and the above video, you can understand the whole story of machine learning.</p>
<p>In addition, if you start using Google&rsquo;s machine learning library called TensorFlow with the following teaching materials, I think that the basics as a machine learning engineer have been roughly suppressed.
Image recognition is on the top and time series data processing is on the bottom.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Experience in 4 days! ] Deep Learning Experience Course with TensorFlow, Keras, Python 3](<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow/">https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow/</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow_rnn/">[Learn with TensorFlow/Keras] Introduction to Time Series Data Processing (RNN/LSTM, Word2Vec)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After that, according to your personal taste, for example,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ml_for_app_developers/">Machine learning practice course for application developers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ai-nlp-bot/">Natural language processing and chatbots: AI-based sentence generation and conversation engine development</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can move on to learning a little more practical content such as.</p>
<p>#Summary</p>
<p>The above is a personal recommended study order.
My stance is that in &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to understand the mathematical foundations at all and I don&rsquo;t want to understand programming at all&rdquo;, AI is forever unknown.However, if you understand a little math and programming and are willing to understand properly, I wanted to tell you that it is not difficult at all.</p>
<p>I hope this article helps people who are trying to understand AI and deep learning from now on.</p>
