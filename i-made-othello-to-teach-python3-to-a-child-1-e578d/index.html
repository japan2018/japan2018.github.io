<pre><code>#Python3 Let's make an Othello game for studying
</code></pre>
<p>Since my self-restraining life has been prolonged, it is inevitable to spend a dull day without doing anything, so I started studying Python3. python is a language, but applications of that language include standalone scripts, cloud services, games, <a href="http://www.turbare.net/transl/scipy-lecture-notes/intro/index.html">science and technology calculation</a> is really wide. For the time being, I would like to learn python by looking back at the basics of programs.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This is an article I wrote to teach my son, but it seems that Qiita responds better than I thought, so there are many people who want to teach programs to their children, and many people want to study programs more easily. I felt that Since writing this article, my son has come to express his daily life programmatically. As we will see below, the only basis of the program is &ldquo;actions, conditions, repetition&rdquo;. Therefore, I am laughing by expressing programmatically that my mom is angry and I ask for my pocket money. On the other hand, my son&rsquo;s ambition is big, and he says, &ldquo;I want to make a game like Fortnite!&quot;**. That&rsquo;s good, of course, but it&rsquo;s frustrating if you suddenly have a big goal. This is, so to speak, the same as saying, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t study English first, you can&rsquo;t understand the English dictionary of legal terms&rdquo;. &ldquo;If you understand the language of Python and the nature of the program, you can start programming with 3D modeling like Unity, but suddenly it will be too difficult to get into Unity.&rdquo;
The program I wrote here was faithfully built on this basis so as not to deviate from &ldquo;action, condition, repetition&rdquo; as much as possible. So please forgive me for any code that seems redundant.
The source code described here can be modified as often as you like and you can use it with any kind of modification. Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>
<h2 id="simple-program">Simple program</h2>
<p>When learning programming, I often worry about learning a language or a library. For many of today&rsquo;s advanced programming environments, understanding libraries and classes is more important than language itself. In terms of language, if you understand c, c++, java, and php, python seems to be a relatively sunnari language.</p>
<p>By the way, I think that the most boring and least useful sample program for studying programming languages is called Hello World. There is no sample program that will discourage the learner in studying the program.</p>
<p>Therefore, Hello World is not used in this content. Instead, I would like to make an Othello game.</p>
<h2 id="there-are-only-3-basic-programs-">There are only 3 basic programs! ?</h2>
<p>No matter what language you use, there are only three basics you need to write a program.</p>
<p>| Basics | Description: |
|:&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;|:&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;|
| Action (control statement) | Take a step forward |
| Judgment (conditional sentence) | Do you hit the wall? |
| Repeat | Repeat a certain number of times, repeat forever |</p>
<p>Writing like a program looks like this. When the program hits a wall, it turns to the right and keeps going until then. It will be a program that will last forever because it repeats forever. Yes, this is the end of studying the basics of the program.</p>
<pre><code>Repeat forever{
Hit the wall?
Yes: Turn your body to the right
No: Go forward
}
</code></pre><h2 id="python-is-basically-indented">Python is basically indented</h2>
<p>If you are learning Python, it is necessary to explain only here in advance.</p>
<p>Python has enforced a language structuring called indentation. As a result, it is possible to write programs that are easy to read and not redundant even as a creator. In Python, indent to indicate that the block of the program matched the condition. In the following program, if the condition is &ldquo;31st December in 2020&rdquo;, the message &ldquo;Because it is the end of the year, the next day is 1st January 2021&rdquo; is displayed, and the year is incremented by 1 and the month is set to 1 The program to reset.</p>

This is a program in which the day is reset to 1.</p>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="lets-actually-make-an-othello-game-">Let&rsquo;s actually make an Othello game! !!</h2>
<p>Now, I would like to make an Othello game immediately, right? Suddenly? Haven&rsquo;t studied Python? You may think, but the way to study here is to start by learning what you have made. Become a Python master while creating an Othello game! !!</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the Othello game is a board game in which the player who wins a lot of positions using black and white pieces in the 8×8 squares wins the game.</p>
<p>Once you have created the logic of the Othello game, you can remake the program into a communication battle game or a good-looking game with graphic variations, so here is a simple CUI-based Othello game. Let&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>This time, I will use a development tool called PyCharm for programming. If you do not have it, please download and install PyCharm from the following site.</p>
<p>Download PyCharm from here &raquo;&gt; <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/ja-jp/pycharm/">Python IDE-PyCharm</a></p>
<p>The finished Othello game will be a text-based Othello game like this. It&rsquo;s simple, but it&rsquo;s an Othello game that can be played by two people properly, so let&rsquo;s make it together!
