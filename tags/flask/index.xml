      <description>#Introduction  It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since AI became stronger than professional shogi players.
On the other hand, Professor Zenji Hanyu** &amp;ldquo;** Things like entertaining shogi are difficult for AI**,&amp;rdquo; he said.
Then, what kind of point is difficult when actually trying to make entertainment AI, What level of &amp;ldquo;entertainment&amp;rdquo; can we do?
This is a development diary record of the difficult challenge of &amp;ldquo;entertainment shogi&amp;rdquo;. It is a story up to the idea of the entertainment AI obtained.</description>

      <description># Article summary  I wanted to put the sales involved in the development with GitHub Flow, that is, the development with a simple pull operation, and created such an environment. At that time, I made and released a web application that supplements some missing functions, so I will write various stories about it. (It&amp;rsquo;s not about whether or not you can actually use this web app, but rather that you want to improve your development with a similar flow.</description>

      <description>Let&#39;s try the title as easily as possible.  Blueprint allows you to implement the functionality of your application in pieces. Blueprint is officially recommended as a way to organize bloated projects.
Install Flask $ sudo pip3 install flask Directory structure $ cd ~/workspace/sample-flask/ $ls server.py from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) @app.route(&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;) def func_1(): return&amp;#39;Hello world&amp;#39; @app.route(&amp;#39;/test&amp;#39;) def func_2(): return&amp;#39;Test&amp;#39; if __name__ ==&amp;#39;__main__&amp;#39;: app.run(host=&amp;#39;0.0.0.0&amp;#39;, port=80, debug=True) Execution command $python3 server.</description>

So, I got a pretty good result, so I will write the technical background until it started as a service as it is.</description>

      <title>[Python] Simulate temperature measurement with Raspberry Pi &#43; Flask &#43; SQLite &#43; Ajax</title>

      <description>#Introduction  It is convenient to be able to debug with software alone when measuring temperature with Raspberry Pi and acquiring sensor status with GPIO. Therefore, we created a debug environment that simulates temperature measurement and acquisition of sensor status with GPIO, and displays it on a website (created with Flask). Save the simulated temperature and sensor state in SQLite and refresh the page via Ajax. The temperature and sensor values are hard to understand, so it looks as if the living room temperature and sensor had changed.</description>

      <description>I made a simple API using the following Python Web framework and tried a load test.   Django (2.X) Flask FastAPI responder japronto  As a result, I found the following roughly!
 Performance can be said to be &amp;ldquo;japronto &amp;raquo;&amp;gt; FastAPI&amp;gt; responder &amp;raquo;&amp;gt; Flask ~ Django&amp;rdquo; FastAPI and responder are single workers, and if they request about 100-1000 seconds per second**, they have overwhelming performance in the python world almost the same level as japronto**  (The code used for the verification is here.</description>

      <description>Let&#39;s create an image recognition application using Python, Flask, and PyTorch.  If you combine these three, you can make a demo app easily and explosively.
#Introduction
What is Flask A web framework for Python. Django is a popular Python web framework, but Flask sells lightweight. Compared to Django, there are few functions and extension libraries, but the code is simple due to the restrictions, and you can easily create applications.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Hi, this is Lux Advent Calendarof8daysinchargeMasaKu.
Previously posted API news articlemakesmefeelbetterifIstillgetagoodfeeling,andIwanttoattackthisyear&amp;rsquo;sarticlewithAPInews.Itwas.(Fullviewofthelowerheart)
This time, I will introduce a super simple REST API creation method using Flask which is a Python framework.
Because REST API can be created with a simple notation, it is also recommended for those who want to study the front firmly for personal development but want to make the back end quickly.

      <description>The web application we will create this time is an OCR (character recognition) application that will upload an image containing characters and will recognize it and display it as a string.  The app uses Python 3, Flask, Cognitive Services from Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s AI service, and more. Deployment to the cloud (Microsoft Azure) is automatic deployment of git push trigger.
Thank you! This OCR app is made by Microsoft engineer Christopher Harrison.</description>

      <description>When implementing a web application using Python in business, we decided to introduce the Clean Architecture to develop while separating the concerns for each layer.  We&amp;rsquo;ve put together a set of practices for developing testable applications, using progressive typing and Dependency Injection to share knowledge with team members.
Clean Architecture This time, since the purpose is a sample using Python, the explanation of Clean Architecture will be simple.

      <description>Learning #Flask  Flask because I touched both bottle and Django. We will use the Twitter API again as usual.
$python3 -m venv flaskworks $ ls flaskworks/ $ .flaskworks/bin/activate (flaskworks)$ pip install flask (flaskworks)$ pip install requests requests_oauthlib It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to create a directory like a bottle.
(flaskworks)$ cd flaskworks (flaskworks)$ mkdir static (flaskworks)$ mkdir templates Make a template Two are created because the template inheritance is used.
