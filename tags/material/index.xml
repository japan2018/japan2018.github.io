A chocolate snack made and sold by Meiji Co., Ltd. since 1975. It has a cute mushroom-like shape with crackers on the stem and chocolate on the umbrella. It was said that the best combination was tried and errored over a development period of 5 years, and while it was easy to hold and functional, it had plenty of chocolate and a moderately salty and crispy feel.</description>

      <description># Overview  A long time ago, there was a story that said, &amp;ldquo;The most stinky hottogigisu who won the championship 1&amp;rdquo;. If it&#39;s a crow, invite me to nothingness (Izanae) Totogi (Hototogisu) It&amp;rsquo;s like Growing my jet black flame, Firetogisu.
I like all the works, but it&amp;rsquo;s useless even if this kind of hand is too far from the original material, and the best taste is to keep the shape and meaning similar to the original material and to have a sense of jerk I wonder if it is.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  The news is about the news that Carlos Ghosn, the former chairman of Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., broke bail conditions and traveled to Lebanon. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking for a long time, but it&amp;rsquo;s similar to Mr. Bean&amp;hellip; Left: [Carlos Ghosn](https://www.google.com/search?q=Carlos+Ghosn&amp;amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNS1gsNQxqfqi7GRWUUeSSZ6CRix8w:1577813710879&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;Ah&amp;amp;EqjQAQBQ&amp;amp;QAQBQBQ&amp;amp;QAQBQ&amp;amp;QB Right: [Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson)](https://www.google.com/search?q=rowan+atkinson&amp;amp;biw=1386&amp;amp;bih=710&amp;amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNTsdddnLF7jgPr9RTePeEMGgREpyA:1577813660092&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;saQ&amp;amp;isch&amp;amp;saq
It was a year-end and New Year holiday, so I made a little classifier using a neural network. If you google it, a lot of images of the two people will appear, so it was good for CNN, but This time, as another approach, I would like to perform classification based on the position of landmarks on the face.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  One day, I found this article. O(1) sort faster than Stalin sort
 &amp;ldquo;Squeeze the truth and release predetermined information&amp;rdquo;
 So, this sort of name, called the Otomu Announcement Sort, looks interesting. I searched for other things, and found various things, so I will summarize them.
Try to implement Sort by the announcement def propaganda_sort(list): return [1, 2, 3] input [3, 4, 6, 1, 2, 5, 9, 8, 10, 7] output [1, 2, 3] It&amp;rsquo;s an algorithm that seems to be that way.</description>
