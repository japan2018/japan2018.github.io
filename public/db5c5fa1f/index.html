<p>It has already been released.</p>
<p>Machine learning
・Implementation of various algorithms
・Mechanism of operation of each algorithm</p>
<p>I wrote this for those who want to learn these.</p>
<p>We hope you can utilize it.</p>
<p>Books I wrote last year</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4839970254/">Learn While Making! Development Deep Learning with PyTorch (Yutaro Ogawa, Mynavi Publishing)</a></p>
<p>It is positioned like a machine learning version.</p>
<p>In this article,
・The motivation for writing this book
・Outline of this document
・Contents of this document
I will introduce.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-for-writing-this-book">Motivation for writing this book</h2>
<p>This book is co-authored by my colleague Mr. Shimizu and I (Ogawa).</p>
<p>We were doing business such as &ldquo;machine learning and education support for AI utilization&rdquo; in-house,</p>
<p>The complaint I had at that time was</p>
<p>&ldquo;Machine learning, implementation of scikit-learn and explanation of operation principle of various algorithms,
There are no books that write in good balance~&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was that.</p>
<p>Also,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sad that there are no books written by Japanese that cover scikit-learn to some extent.&rdquo;
I also thought.</p>
<p>At that time,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4873117984/">Machine Learning Beginning with Python-Basics of Feature Engineering and Machine Learning Learned with scikit-learn</a></p>
<p>Was mainly used.</p>
<p>After that as an aid
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B07BF5QZ41/">[2nd Edition] Python Machine Learning Programming Theory and Practice by Master Data Scientists</a></p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>● For new graduates and mid-career recruits newly assigned to their team (AI Technology Department),
Write a book that you can hand over, &ldquo;Machine learning: In order to hold down the knowledge and skills of scikit-learn, please read and learn this book first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>●I want a person who is involved in machine learning in the business field to implement various algorithms that I want AI engineers to hold down this much, and write a book that can understand the operating principle!</p>
<p>I wrote this book with the motivation.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-this-document">Overview of this document</h2>
<p>The machine learning algorithms described in this document are as follows.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/191401/a15ec5a4-f9fe-c21c-fd7e-13b1ec64c773.png" alt="ssss.PNG"></p>
<p>In Chapter 2,
Linear regression, regularization, logistic regression,
SVC (Support Vector Machine Classification)
Decision tree, random forest
Naive Bayes</p>
<p>In Chapter 3,
Principal component analysis, k-means, Gaussian mixture model</p>
<p>In Chapter 4,
Gradient boosting decision tree, elbow method and silhouette analysis, t-SNE,
Abnormality detection Novelty Detection,
Outlier Detection</p>
<p>And in Chapter 5,
Machine learning system construction flow and performance evaluation</p>
<p>Is explained.</p>
<p>Excerpts of about 6 pages of the image on paper.
The atmosphere is as follows.
*Although two pages are listed, they are not two consecutive pages.</p>

<p>For each algorithm, a simple implementation example is given, followed by a description of the operating principle of the algorithm (algorithm, mind).</p>
<h2 id="contents-of-this-document">Contents of this document</h2>
<p>The contents and contents of this manual are as follows.</p>
<p>Basically, for each algorithm</p>
<p>· Basic flow of algorithm, overview
· Implementation and execution of the program

· At the end</p>
<p>Is repeated.</p>

<p>● In the last</p>
<p>In my case, I usually write books after hours.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m asked, &ldquo;How do you devote time to writing a book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I started to write about my work style around that in my Qiita article with my real name.</p>
<p><a href="https://qiita.com/Yutaro_Ogawa">https://qiita.com/Yutaro_Ogawa</a></p>
<p>We hope you will read this article along with this book.</p>
<p>● Addition</p>
<p>With just this, it will be like a book advertisement, so match this book,
<strong>Summary of know-how and tips for Python implementation that AI engineers should be careful</strong>
Will be added.</p>
<p>The article will be too long, so I&rsquo;ll split it up below.
We would appreciate it if you could read it together.</p>
