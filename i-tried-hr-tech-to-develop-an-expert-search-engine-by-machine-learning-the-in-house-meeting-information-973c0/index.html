<pre><code>## TL; DR
</code></pre>
<p>We will create an expert search engine by utilizing the dark data that sleeps inside the company and the data related to meetings.

<p>This will help you find the in-house expert and the contact path to that expert.</p>
<h2 id="1-background--">1. Background. .. ..</h2>
<h3 id="11-what-is-work-style-reform">1.1 What is work style reform?</h3>
<p>It is often said that <a href="https://jinjibu.jp/keyword/detl/909/">Jitahara</a> has work style reform.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jitahara:
Forcing employees to leave the company, such as “Do not work overtime” and “Return on time” without specific measures to reduce overtime hours</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is. Serious people will return home as they are told, and they will take it home and work overtime.
** It&rsquo;s stupid! ! ! **</p>
<h3 id="12-meetings-would-you-like-to-reduce-it">1.2 Meetings&hellip; Would you like to reduce it?</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASM4L7FYGM4LULZU015.html">Asahi Shimbun</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lost useless meetings at large companies: 670,000 hours per year and 1.5 billion yen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. I will ask straightforwardly.</p>
<p>** Can you reduce the number of meetings? **
** If we can reduce the amount by 1.5 billion yen, it would be nice to get rewards like Mr. Ghosn. **</p>
<p>There is so much know-how in the world! ! ! !</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/109411/12af0821-935b-4b12-e493-566c10ac5071.png" alt="kaigi_sakugen.png"></p>
<p>But why doesn&rsquo;t it change over the years? .. .. .. ..
Personally, I don&rsquo;t think I really want to reduce the number of meetings or the time. In short, the know-how that comes out by google would be a no-brainer alone.</p>
<h3 id="13-meeting-will-you-use-the-data">1.3 Meeting-Will you use the data?</h3>
<p>If it is a venture, if the scale exceeds 300 people*, then the work of one employee will be limited.
*According to the definition of small and medium-sized enterprises, it depends on the type of industry, but [it seems to be a large enterprise if it exceeds at least 300](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%B0%25(8F%E4%BC%81%E6%A5%AD)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%B0%(8F%E4%BC%81%E6%A5%AD)</a></p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re not doing anything.
Let&rsquo;s use <strong>a little</strong> instead of reducing the number of meetings without thinking (rant) as you and my company do.</p>
<h2 id="2-issues-and-solution-policy">2. Issues and solution policy</h2>
<h3 id="21-issues-that-are-likely-to-be-large-companies">2.1 Issues that are likely to be large companies</h3>
<p>As an issue that tends to occur in organizations where the number of employees including the group exceeds a certain number,</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to know about XX, but I do not know who to ask **</li>
<li>I understand the listener, but I have no acquaintance ** It is difficult to talk suddenly **</li>
</ul>
<p>What&rsquo;s the matter? There is?</p>
<p>So, I will set this as a problem to be solved.</p>
<h3 id="22-resolution-policy">2.2 Resolution policy</h3>
<p>It is uselessly accumulated and is probably the first of <a href="https://tech.nikkeibp.co.jp/atcl/nxt/column/18/00001/02248/">Dark Data</a>? I will use the conference data that seems to be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dark data
Refers to “data that can generate value within a company but is not utilized”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is only accumulated and not utilized. Even if I googled it, I could not find any use cases. What a waste.
*If it comes out normally, I&rsquo;m sorry for my googling skill. .. .. ..</p>
<h3 id="23-features-of-meeting-data">2.3 Features of meeting data</h3>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s think about the characteristics of the conference data.</p>
<h4 id="merit">merit</h4>
<ul>
<li>(Generally) open data in-house</li>
<li>Covers all employees (though management may be private)</li>
<li>real time</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="demerit">Demerit</h4>
<ul>
<li>** May be personal information **</li>
<li>If so, it may be necessary to consider the handling policy (troublesome)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some disadvantages, but&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="61-first-the-home-screen">6.1 First, the Home screen!</h2>
<p>If the home screen is dull, some people may just leave.
So, I tried my best to feel <strong>cool on my own basis</strong> (allocation error)</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/109411/6ab4b3c4-1b97-22c1-a6d7-5a953d0c2d8e.png" alt="hrsearch-min.png"></p>
<h2 id="62-search-for-experts">6.2 Search for experts</h2>
<p>Select Keyword Search from the left pane menu to search for people by word.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/109411/7df6f667-4898-d9c4-930f-5654c1f787f0.png" alt="keywordsearch-min.png"></p>
<p>To! If you search for the word machine learning, you&rsquo;ll find the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in it**
By the way, AI looks like this.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/109411/87977d96-032c-fc07-9871-5394a24ae6f2.png" alt="AI-min.png"></p>
<p>It should be noted that the colors are clustered by people who are similar to each other to some extent, and have different colors for each cluster.
It might have been better to separate by political party here, but since it&rsquo;s <em>not easy yet</em>, I&rsquo;ll leave it as it is.</p>
<h2 id="63-search-in">6.3 Search in</h2>
<p>Next is the connection search.
From Member&rsquo;s Search, search for Prime Minister Abe&rsquo;s connection (here, a person with a similar statement).</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/109411/60bcb6c1-6bfb-5e0c-8fbb-3c4245ecd620.png" alt="membersearch-min.png"></p>
<p>I see. .. .. .. (While looking at this in the minutes data of the Diet, no impressions came out.)
I&rsquo;m sure it would be a little interesting if I feed actual meeting data in-house. .. .. ..</p>
<h2 id="64-search-contacts">6.4 Search contacts</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s finally time to search for contacts (what I wanted to do the most).
Then, Prime Minister Abe and his sword? Let&rsquo;s examine the connection with Taro Aso&rsquo;s Finance Minister.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/109411/d4e732ff-1f7c-a643-3530-535cacd862b0.png" alt="connection1-min.png"></p>
<p>Based on the content of your remarks, Mr. Toshio Beppu is sandwiched in the middle.
This area depends on the model that we have trained, so we&rsquo;ll choose it for now.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s examine the connection between Prime Minister Abe and Representative Taro Yamamoto. (Because I was a Diet member who came up with something)</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/109411/9fc6335c-9dce-8ec1-30fa-f3a171e1b46b.png" alt="connection2-min.png"></p>
<p>Along the way, three people aren&rsquo;t caught. Is that so?</p>
<h2 id="65-suggestion-of-search-target-words">6.5 Suggestion of search target words</h2>
<p>Since there are many words that can be searched and many people are targeting, validation is performed before throwing a search query. However, since it is difficult to know what kind of words are OK, we have implemented a function to display search word candidates when you start entering a word.</p>
<p><img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/109411/b6df2b89-bfdf-b1ce-f5ef-be6389b93fb2.png" alt="support-min.png"></p>
<p>Now you can search for any word and feel safe!</p>
<h1 id="7-development-impression">7 Development impression</h1>
<p>What I thought about making so far is that <strong>UX design and UI design are important</strong>. .. .. ..</p>
<p>Preparation of learning data, cleansing, morphological analysis, machine learning, and API development were all difficult. I think it was because the goal was clear as such.</p>
<p>However, since I started to make the front end without a clear image, I did not repeat it. Thanks to that, the source code also feels a little bad and it is painful. .. .. ..</p>
<p>This screen, which I think is not good enough for me, is a sweet pepper.</p>
<h1 id="8-finally-for-work-style-reform">8 Finally, for work style reform</h1>
<p>I showed you a screen based on the minutes data of the Diet here, but I decided to try learning data from the meeting data of my company and operate it in-house. I think that I will get various opinions, so please consider all positively,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That? Who knows this?
Oh, I&rsquo;m lucky if I search for it with this, YO!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone thought,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this person doing this kind of work?
Then, next time, let&rsquo;s talk a little and try to breast up the idea of the plan!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would be happy if you thought about it.</p>
