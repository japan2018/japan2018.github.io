      <description>#This grade  #This impression
(I had no motivation for a competition professional because I was soaked in skis for 3 weeks, but I would like to resume from today (2/26)) I couldn&amp;rsquo;t solve up to C this time. I felt the importance of devotion because the assumed solution of D was not difficult as an idea when I saw the solution by binary search. For E, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do a good job of distinguishing whether to carry or not.</description>
