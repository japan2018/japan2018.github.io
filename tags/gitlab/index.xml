      <description># Background  Since joining the company as an infrastructure engineer and working on AWS projects, I have been writing more Python for CloudFormation and Lambda. The name of Git/GitHub/GitLab was at a level I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about, but the version control mentioned above is mandatory, and you will be using your own GitLab. Although I was an amateur, I immediately felt the convenience, and I thought that it would be better if I could establish GitLab after studying Docker on ESXi at home.</description>
