      <description>#Introduction  I originally used a script to change the item names in batch with REAPER, so I used it,
When the tracks were separated, it felt like the name was poured into each track. I wish it was a single track, but&amp;hellip;
When I noticed it, it was divided into tracks.
So I wrote a script to fill in the names in chronological order.
(Also, if there are too many numbers, it seems that the letters are over, so it only worked halfway)</description>
