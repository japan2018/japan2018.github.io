      <title>[Python] Roughly speed up Python with numba</title>

      <description>A library called [numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) can speed up Python code relatively easily.  Hopefully you can speed it up by writing from numba import jit and writing @jit in the line before the function you want to speed up.
As a mechanism, numba seems to get the virtual machine code of Python, compile it into LLVM IR, and make it native code using LLVM. At the first execution, the compile process runs, so it will be slightly slower, but if it is a heavy process, numba may be faster from the viewpoint of compile time.</description>

      <title>[Python] [Memorandum] Python calculation speedup (may be) module Numba related summary</title>

      <description>I want to run a #Python program at high speed!  ** &amp;ldquo;If you can calculate 10 times faster, you can make 10 times more failures&amp;rdquo; ** If you think so, everyone should think that it would be good to be able to calculate quickly.
As for the title, Numba, it is a module that can accelerate the calculation on Python by using JIT (just-in-time) compiler. This article is a memorandum of past excellent articles about Numba.</description>
