      <description>#Overview  It seems that a coding test is conducted in an engineer&amp;rsquo;s interview overseas, and in many cases, the main thing is to implement a specific function or class according to the subject.
As a countermeasure, it seems that the site called Leet Code will be implemented.
A site that trains the algorithm power to withstand the coding tests that are being conducted in the early days.
I think it is better to have at least as much algorithmic power as an impatient person, so I think that I will occasionally solve the problem and write down the method I thought at that time in a memo.</description>

      <title>(WIP) Verify Bresenham&#39;s algorithm for drawing line segments</title>

      <description># Status  For now, up to drawing and proof by human power. Next, I would like to prove it with a theorem proof system such as TLA+ or Coq. By the way, the vertical position of MathJax is too misaligned, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?
Overview The Bresenham algorithm is an algorithm for drawing a line segment on a screen expressed in pixels. Pixel coordinates can only have integer values, so an approximation algorithm is needed.</description>

      <description>## Differences between machine learning, statistics and data science  Machine Learning (ML), Statistics, Data Science. All of these words are often heard due to the rapid spread of AI in recent years, but what is the difference between them? There is no definite answer, but to put it simply, firstly Data Science is a field that combines specialized fields such as statistics, computer science, and business. I think it will be easier to understand if you look at the figure below.</description>
