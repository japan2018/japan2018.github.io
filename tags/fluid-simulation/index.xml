      <description>## Introduction  While studying Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), I would like to summarize the knowledge necessary for constructing a computational fluid dynamics analysis code. It seems that there are many mistakes, so please feel free to contact us if you find it.
Target audience  People who can use Python People who are interested in numerical calculation People who are interested in fluid mechanics Those who understand basic university physics and mathematics (simple differential equations and linear algebra?</description>

      <description>#Introduction  While also studying Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which is a discipline related to the simulation of fluids such as air and water, I would like to summarize (in multiple articles) the knowledge necessary to construct a numerical fluid analysis code for water.
I feel that computational fluid dynamics is a difficult academic subject, so I would like to write it so that even beginners can understand it as much as possible.</description>
