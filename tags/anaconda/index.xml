      <description>I have summarized how to build Python and Jupyter execution environment with VS Code. I use Anaconda.  Also, I think that many people who analyze data with Python use Jupyter notebook and Jupyter Lab from their browsers. VS Code is also recommended for such people.
Also, this article is part of the article How to create a Python package using VS Code.
We will proceed on the assumption that Anaconda has been downloaded.</description>

      <description># In a nutshell  Purchase a cheap gaming PC (Windows), Enable to switch CPU/GPU in virtual environment of Anaconda, Tensorflow-Running the GPU (v2.0) code, With 4 patterns including CPU/GPU of Colaboratory, I compared the performance. I will summarize the performance comparison results and the Windows version environment construction procedure. Article.
*I often hear that GPU is effective for machine learning
 Gaming PCs have GPUs and are cheap these days  â‡’ ** Let&amp;rsquo;s use GPU of gaming PC for machine learning!</description>

      <description>#Background  When I made a Python environment with Anaconda + VS Code, I was troubled because the latest setting method did not come out, so I will publish my notes for those who will do it now. It seems that there was a VS Code specification change around 2017. Be careful when reading old commentary.

      <description>#Introduction  Everyone, do you like data analysis __?
Nice to meet you! I&amp;rsquo;m @haraso_1130 who is the mentor at DMM WEB CAMP
Suddenly, look at the image below.
What a property in 23 wards of Tokyo is 5DK 80,000 yen! ? If you are in the 23 wards, you can comfortably do 80,000 a room a month &amp;hellip;
This property is Using &amp;ldquo;Python&amp;rdquo; Collecting data by &amp;ldquo;scraping&amp;rdquo; Results of data analysis using &amp;ldquo;machine learning&amp;rdquo; It is a property that we were able to discover.</description>

      <description># First of all  This article is from the 7th day of the DMM WEBCAMP Advent Calendar. This time it&amp;rsquo;s a super introduction, so I created it for those who have never tried machine learning but want to start **.
The purpose is to get a rough idea of machine learning and try to implement a basic simple perceptron for the time being, so I&amp;rsquo;ve written a lot about the explanation of machine learning etc.</description>

      <description>[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is, in a word, a library of scientific computations etc. attached from the beginning in addition to Python itself. In addition, it has been devised to simplify package management and deployment, and comes with a package management command called conda.  About conda and pip The Python world has been around for quite some time with its own package management tools, which used to be EasyInstall, and later to use pip.</description>
