      <description>Recently, new pneumonia has become popular.  Since I had previously conducted a study using a mathematical model of infectious disease called SIR model, I applied it to a new model of pneumonia. Mathematical models can be used to predict the future of infectious diseases.
This time, we focus on Wuhan*** Hubei Province*** (provinces including Wuhan), which is the center of the outbreak, to model infectious diseases and predict the future of infectious diseases.</description>
