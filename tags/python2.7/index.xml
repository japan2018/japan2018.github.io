      <description>*Memo will be updated at any time*  Aiming to build a python development environment
In the environment I upgraded from Mojave to Catalina, when I did it normally, it did not work as expected with python3 or pip3 due to the difference in version, so I try using pyenv and see if it works.
It&amp;rsquo;s actually better to use Docker, but for now&amp;hellip;

      <description>This article is the 8th day article of [**Houdini Advent Calender 2019**](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/houdini).

On the other hand, if management and documentation are not maintained, **you can not understand how to use HDA created by others, and you can not know what kind of HDA exists **.
This article will show you how to create tooltips and your own documentation for the parameters shown below.</description>

      <description>I couldn&#39;t find any more detailed explanation about findcontours for Python version of OpenCV on the internet, so I&#39;d like to note that I tried it myself.

The first argument is the input image, the second argument is the extraction mode, and the third argument is the approximation method.</description>
