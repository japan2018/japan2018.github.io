      <description>#TensorBoard accelerates understanding of TensorFlow  I output to TensorBoard in order to check the process of convolution processing and pooling processing of TensorFlow. It is a memo of the image confirmation method at that time. As a premise, please refer to [[Introduction to TensorBoard] Visualize TensorFlow process to deepen understanding] for basic usage. Environment: python3.5 tensorflow1.21
