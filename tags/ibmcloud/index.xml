      <description>#Overview  Do you know IBM MAX? It is provided by IBM and you can use the service that can connect the deep-learned model with REST API as a container compatible with Docker. It can also be called from Node-RED. From around November 2019, it became compatible with IoT devices equipped with ARM CPUs including Raspberry Pi, embedded devices, and PCs equipped with ARM CPU, so in this article, I will use IBM MAX with Raspberry Pi.</description>

      <description># This year again IBM Cloud Ã— LINE bot  In last year&amp;rsquo;s Advent Calendar, we introduced How to make a LINE bot using IBM Cloud Node-RED. Thanks to the Advent Calendar, a recent Google search for &amp;ldquo;Node-RED LINE bot&amp;rdquo; has brought this article to the top. It is good to easily create a LINE bot with Node-RED, but in the case of IBM Cloud&amp;rsquo;s Node-RED, if you do not edit the flow for a while with a light plan, the application will stop and the LINE bot may not work.</description>
