      <description>There was a person in charge of specialized infrastructure related things in the company, and he was kind to the environment, but it would be bad if I had to study Docker around myself as soon as possible. I&#39;ve finally been introduced to Docker recently, so I&#39;ll try to put together and try what I have learned as a memorandum.  Since I have been working on unfamiliar work such as infrastructure around my career, please forgive me for things that are rough (shallow) in terms of knowledge.</description>
