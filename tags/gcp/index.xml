      <description>As a hobby, I personally developed a web service that AI automatically marks the readability of characters when I write them in a browser, and released it about 2 weeks ago: relaxed:  []((https://letters.choo.works/) Letters-AI handwriting scoring app
The core technology is front-end implementation with DeepLearning image recognition and Preact. In this article, we will describe Service outline, technical details, and impressions regarding the developed application.
Service overview Function introduction Since it has a small number of pages and is lightweight, it is probably faster to see the application regarding the function, but I will explain the function including an overview of the technology used with screenshots.</description>

      <description>#GCP had a great feature added  Previously, I wrote an article Easily build a GCP environment for Kaggle. This time, I found an easier way to build it, so I&amp;rsquo;ll write it as an improved version of the previous article. A notebook function has been added to the lower AI platform. What this means is that you can get it ready for use without having to do the work to make the jupyter notebook introduced in the previous article.</description>

      <description>#Background  How are AWS certified measures taken? AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solution Architect â€“ Associates have a copy of the test book and a practice test, making it an easy environment for studying the test. However, after the developer-associate, there are few Japanese language study books, so if you want to do a mock exam, UdemyandWhizlabs.However,mostofthepracticetestsonthesesitesareinEnglish.(AsofDecember03,2019,thereisoneJapanesemockexaminUdemy)
Difference between Udemy and Whizlabs I thought it would be better to do a lot of mock exams, so I tried English mock exams at Udemy and Whizlabs.</description>
