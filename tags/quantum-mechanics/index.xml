      <description>Hello Sugo of Quemix.  Here is an overview of the projects currently underway at IPA&amp;rsquo;s unexplored business. By making a game that includes the properties of quantum, we are going to make two games within the period. This time, we will introduce the first game.
#Notes If you try to explain everything such as the history of the game, the details of the rules, the explanation of quantum, etc. so that it can be understood by those who are new to the game, the amount will be too large, so it is a rather broken introduction Please note.</description>
