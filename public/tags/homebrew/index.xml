      <description># Overview  This article is a step-by-step article on how a beginner himself developed a coupon distribution service for iPhone with RESTful API and swift. It was a very detouring implementation because we implemented it while examining the technical elements one by one.
Python is originally installed on the Mac, but the version is old as of OS 10.15. When actually writing Python, everyone seems to have been updated to 3 series.</description>

      <description>## I was annoyed by ImportError  Install python with homebrew and django with pip. However, it fails when the server starts.
$ python manage.py runserver  ImportError: No module named django.core.management
 Actually, Python is included in the Mac from the beginning Launch the Terminal app and check the version
$ python --version  Python 2.7.5
 I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice this, and I thought it was Python installed with homebrew.</description>
