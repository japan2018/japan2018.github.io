      <description>#Continuing from the previous session  This article is an application of Python visualization tools. ~~ Since it has become long, I decided to divide the application into two. (Application 2 is still being written) ~~ The application section was added to this article to make it one. If you are new to Python plot, I wrote the basic version last time, so please check here! #Introduction I am currently a graduate student with a 2nd year master&amp;rsquo;s degree.</description>
