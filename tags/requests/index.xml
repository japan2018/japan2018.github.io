      <description># Overview  In this article, I created an infinite loading page. You can&amp;rsquo;t get the source from curl or requests, which is a common usage for such pages, so you need to do something special. This time I will write the code to get the contents of this page.
#Environment *python 3.8.1
#Code Get the source for the page created by the code of This article. When the time and the number of acquired bytes are reached, the code acquired up to that point is output.</description>
