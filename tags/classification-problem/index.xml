      <description># What is a classification problem  The classification problem is to classify data into several categories and is one of the typical methods of machine learning.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a purchasing site as an example. Predict whether a user will buy or not buy a new product based on the user&amp;rsquo;s purchasing information. Classification into two categories (classes) is called binary classification.
Classification predictions with more than two classes are called multiclass classifications.</description>
