      <description>Ohashi is in a hurry with two advent calendars on the same day.  I have been working with GAE/Py for the last two years or so. Until now, I have touched GAE/J and GAE/Go, and since I am returning GAE/Py, I have a lot of things to think about, but I think GAE is so wonderful, I wonder if I&amp;rsquo;m not using SQL anymore? , I&amp;rsquo;m wondering why I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have forced this application into Datastore.</description>
