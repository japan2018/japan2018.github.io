      <description>#Introduction  In this article, I am an aspiring engineer with a programming Wakaba mark on my chest, OT solves the problem of competitive programming given at At. It is an article. You may disappear in despair on the way, but I would like to continue until I get a job! !
#First, a simple profile Name: OT Programming history: 3 months (TECH::EXPERT63 period) Languages available: Ruby (level to make a simple website with Rails), C# (level to make a simple Othello with Unity), Python (&amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; level) Favorite celebrity: Gacky</description>

      <description>Hello, this is day 23 of the [ABEJA Advent Calendar](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/abeja).  Introduction Do you all know the library faiss?ItisaneighborhoodsearchlibraryofFacebookResarch,anditisveryeasytouseTutorial, so it is frequently used for both business and hobby. Yes. However, such a useful library has its weak points. When I try to do something a little niche, it&amp;rsquo;s just saying &amp;ldquo;Well, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain the details and see the test code to get a feel for it (-д☆) Kiratsu&amp;rdquo;. I actually read the test code, and sometimes I read the C++ code of the main unit to study how to use it, so I will write it with a reminder for myself in the future.</description>

      <title>[Python] Numerical calculation of compressible fluid by finite volume method</title>

      <description># 1.First of all  It is necessary to consider the compressibility of the fluid in the flow around a fast-moving object such as an aircraft or rocket, and in the phenomena involving strong pressure, temperature and density changes such as combustion and explosion. Compressible fluids have various phenomena such as sound waves, shock waves, and aerodynamic heating that are not found in incompressible fluids, and their numerical calculations have different difficulties from incompressible fluids.</description>

      <description>Related article: [Easy Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installation procedure](https://qiita.com/kekenonono/items/1ddbb5a1125d496c0010)  #Introduction I have installed the official release of OpenCV 4.1.2 by make on Ubuntu of WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), so I will leave it as a memorandum.
The target is for those who want to use OpenCV in C++. I will install it so that it can be used with Python2, Python3, but if you want to use only Python, it seems easy to put in opencv-python.</description>

      <title>[Python] Discover the most dangerous functions on github</title>

      <description>## Introduction  The other day, at work, I was excited by &amp;ldquo;I am renovating or writing Ichibanya Bay function&amp;rdquo;. Everyone told me a lot, but it was an overwhelming victory for the &amp;ldquo;command pattern main loop function (1500 lines)&amp;rdquo; I wrote. Why did you write such a code?
So, today, I will discover the &amp;ldquo;most world-wide function&amp;rdquo; from github to heal my injured pride. In other words, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to see a yaw function rather than the one I wrote.</description>
