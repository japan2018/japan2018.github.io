      <description>I will record as a reminder the part that was clogged up when I tried to easily build the environment on my windows notebook using Kaggle&#39;s Docker Image.  Basically, I am referring to the article of &amp;ldquo;Tenshiki Graffiti&amp;rdquo;, so please refer to here first, and OS is not Win10 Pro except windows. And if you are using Docker toolbox, I think it will be helpful.
Stumble point â‘  Execution of yaml of docker-compose does not work due to error of volume name After creating the docker-compose yaml file as in the above article, I got an error.</description>

      <description>#Background  When I made a Python environment with Anaconda + VS Code, I was troubled because the latest setting method did not come out, so I will publish my notes for those who will do it now. It seems that there was a VS Code specification change around 2017. Be careful when reading old commentary.

      <description>#Introduction  While people around me were switching to PyTorch saying that they would like it better, Tensorflow officially made the Tensorboard available, so I decided to change it myself, so I wrote this article.
Target audience official

      <description># I want to run the toio core cube on a familiar PC  The toio core cube is a &amp;ldquo;very cute&amp;rdquo; two-wheeled robot that can be controlled by BLE communication. https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/
The other day, I tried to write a story of trying to move the toio core cube directly using BLE communication with a smartphone, but this time using a personal computer I will move the toio core cube.</description>
