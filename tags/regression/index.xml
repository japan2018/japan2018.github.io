      <description>Hello, this is Motty.  This time, I wrote about regression analysis using Python.
#Regression
Regression analysis is a method of predicting target data using the data at hand. At that time, the structure of quantitative relationships is applied to the data (regression model). If the regression model is a straight line, it is called a regression line, and if an n-order function is applied by polynomial regression, it is called a regression curve.</description>

      <description>#Overview  Hello. A new employee of an IT company. Here, I described a sine wave prediction regression model learning program as a sample using Pytorch which is an open source machine learning library. (It&amp;rsquo;s not a time series forecast&amp;hellip; I also want to do a time series forecast.)
By moving chainer to pytorch, I was late, but I wrote it because I am trying to catch up this time. It also describes what I felt the difference.</description>
