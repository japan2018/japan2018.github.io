      <description>First article posted as job hunting news.  I tried to read and implement a paper on IIC (Invariant Information Clustering), which is said to be highly accurate and has unsupervised learning. IIC is a method of clustering by maximizing mutual information. IIC paper here
 Invariant Information Clustering for Unsupervised Image Classification and Segmentation Xu Ji, Jo√£o F. Henriques, Andrea Vedaldi
 The framework used is TensorFlow 2.0. The target data is familiar MNIST.</description>

      <description>This article is from [Furukawa Lab, Advent_calendar Day 23](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/flab).  #Introduction
GPLVM is an unsupervised learning method that uses Gaussian process (GP) and can estimate low-dimensional manifolds whose data are distributed in high-dimensional space. The main attraction of GPLVM is that the model is very simple and highly expandable, and theoretically easy to handle. In fact, it has been extended to more complex situations such as Bayesian estimation of hyperparameters, time series data analysis 1, multiview analysis 2, and tensor decomposition 3.</description>
