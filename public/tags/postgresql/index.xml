      <description>#Introduction  I wrote this article before. [Build Django development environment with Docker! (Docker-compose/Django/postgreSQL/nginx)]](https://qiita.com/nokonoko_1203/items/242367a83c313a5e46bf)
The original article was written a long time ago (a year or so?), but now that I have enough knowledge, I thought I could make it a little better, so I decided to try it!
I will not talk about installing Docker in detail, so if you are interested, please check the original article! (Here)willhelp.)
Also, as a clear difference from the previous article, Django thinks as an API delivery server and assumes Vue.</description>

      <description>New Corona... The spread of infection is not stopping...  I was thinking that I would like to put some data on a map and visualize it as a fledgling GIS shop, but I was afraid that most of the open data was collected in PDF format.
But! ! ! ! ! !
For non-profit purposes, sites that provide wonderful data with free data duplication, quotation, and reprint (https://gis.jag-japan.com/covid19jp/, so I would like to use this data to express it on the map!</description>

      <description>I tried rebuilding!  Rebuild Django development environment with Docker! ! ! ! 
#Introduction
Team development&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to build an environment&amp;hellip; At that time, use Docker (miscellaneous).
This article is a repost of what I gave to qrunchLet&amp;rsquo;s build a Django/postgreSQL/gunicorn/nginx development environment using Docker and Docker-compose, which are very convenient for team development! !
The whole flow is based on almost the following sites, but I intend to make the article easy to understand, such as putting comments in almost all lines of the configuration file etc.</description>

      <title>[Python] It was too easy to use an existing database with Django</title>

      <description>#Purpose  From an acquaintance who read the article the other day &amp;ldquo;So, if you already have a DB in use, can you attach Django later?&amp;rdquo; There was an arbitrary request, so I also verified it.
If you say from the conclusion, it was possible. Moreover, it is simple. Obviously, it seems that the supported database products and versions are somewhat limited. This area may be helpful.
#manner Reuse the application from the last article, but delete the database side tables.</description>
