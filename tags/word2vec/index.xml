      <description>#Background  It seems that you conducted an interview with a resident in a certain area in a study by a certain university at a certain university, but there was something unconsciously aware of the people in that area based on the content of the hearing. I decided to try it because I wanted to analyze it.
Used MeCab This is also a familiar morphological analysis engine.
What is morphological analysis?</description>

      <description>#Introduction  I have summarized what I have learned about Word2Vec, which is now a standard method for natural language processing. The outline of the algorithm is organized and the model is created using the library.
##reference I have referred to the following to understand Word2Vec.

      <description>I recently attended a Python study group sponsored by Team Zet Co., Ltd. The theme this time is &amp;quot;text emotion using word2vec  &amp;ldquo;Analysis.&amp;rdquo; Honestly, it was a pungent theme for me who first touched Python a week ago, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;m going to experience how the grammar I&amp;rsquo;m studying now is being put into shape. I rushed into the train one day before the event.
By the way, let&amp;rsquo;s leave this foreword and go into the main subject.</description>

      <description>It is the 7th day of [ABEJA Advent Calendar](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/abeja).  #Introduction
Last time, I dropped a piece of information that couldn&amp;rsquo;t make a VIP channel in Slack, but it&amp;rsquo;s not good to think that ABEJA is just playing with VIP, so I decided to send it to Tech a little this time. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll try the following two stories. If it&amp;rsquo;s hard to understand, maybe you can jump to the bottom and see the graph.</description>

      <description>This article is the first day article of [Zeals Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/zeals).  Nice to meet you. This is Tamaki, who will join Zeals from the next fiscal year. Zeals operates a chatbot technology called chat commerce. Also, I am currently researching natural language processing at university. There are conversations in which bots do not have natural language processing, but I thought it would be interesting to add natural language processing technology to them, so I decided to make this the subject of this article.</description>

      <title>[Python] Vectorize sentences and search for similar sentences</title>

      <description>I tried searching for similar sentences with Doc2Vec, so I will introduce the implementation.  What is #Doc2Vec In order for a computer to process natural language, human words must first have a value that the computer can handle. Word2Vec exists as a method to vectorize the meaning of words. For details, the link is very easy to understand, but roughly speaking, it expresses that word in a list of n words before and after.</description>
