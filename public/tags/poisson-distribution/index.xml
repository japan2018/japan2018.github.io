      <description>#Introduction  The Poisson distribution that always appears when studying statistics, but the formula for the probability distribution did not come into my mind at all, so I tried to understand it carefully from the derivation of the probability distribution. I also draw in Python to grab the image.
##reference I have referred to the following to understand the Poisson distribution and draw the distribution.
