      <description>Learning #Flask  Flask because I touched both bottle and Django. We will use the Twitter API again as usual.
$python3 -m venv flaskworks $ ls flaskworks/ $ .flaskworks/bin/activate (flaskworks)$ pip install flask (flaskworks)$ pip install requests requests_oauthlib It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to create a directory like a bottle.
(flaskworks)$ cd flaskworks (flaskworks)$ mkdir static (flaskworks)$ mkdir templates Make a template Two are created because the template inheritance is used.
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;html lang=&amp;#34;ja&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;meta charset=&amp;#34;UTF-8&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;#34;stylesheet&amp;#34; href=&amp;#34;/static/css/style.</description>

      <title>[Python] Vocabulary assessment score distribution</title>
      <link>https://memotut.com/fc49952dd/</link>

      <description>#Vocabulary test  On August 18, 2016, A Certain Diagnosis buzzed.
[Hashtag search #My vocabulary is](https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E7%A7%81%E3%81%AE%E8%AA%9E%E5%BD%99%E5%8A(%9B%E3%81%AF?src=hash)
This diagnosis is scored by answering the four-choice question about 50 synonyms/antagonists and tells you where you are in the distribution.
However, it is obvious that this score is not &amp;ldquo;top 0.43%&amp;rdquo; without searching for the corresponding hashtag #my vocabulary on Twitter&amp;hellip;
So I took the score distribution.
~~** In the first place, I do not say that such a diagnosis has no credibility.</description>
