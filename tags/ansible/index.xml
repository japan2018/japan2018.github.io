      <description>#Introduction  There was a case where I wanted to make a guest VM of Vmware with Ansible like the title and want to use it in various ways, so I tried it with the opportunity. By the way, I thought it would be convenient to use Dynamic Inventory, so I tried it.
Operation verification environment  Vmware side -VMware vCenter Server Appliance, 6.7.0, 42000 -VMware ESXi, 6.7.0, 13006603 Client (Ansible execution environment) side -OS: CentOS 7 -I also tried using python:latest of Docker -Python 3.</description>

      <description>## Self-introduction  I am @yukin01 who is an SRE on the SRE/QA team. I used to use iOS and Firebase/GCP to develop applications until half a year ago, but now that I want to strengthen the infrastructure, I am using AWS and GCP as an SRE at GLOBIS.
Python2 EOL As you know, Python2 is announced to end support on January 1, 2020, but if you have any products or tools that are still dependent on Python2, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to get rid of them by EOL.</description>
