      <description>You can detect updates of blogs that you are interested in through RSS feeds, but sometimes you see the title and say, &amp;quot;Isn&#39;t it necessary to read it?&amp;quot;  It&amp;rsquo;s a hassle to read the titles one by one, so I decided to ask Itako Tohoku of Voiceroid to read the article when I was interested in it.
