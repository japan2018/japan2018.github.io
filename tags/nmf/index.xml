      <description>This article is from the Furukawa Laboratory Advent_calendar 6th day.  This article was written by a student of Furukawa Lab as part of their studies. The content may be ambiguous or the expressions may be slightly different.
#Introduction Since I studied NMF, I will explain it as easily as possible. What is NMF? I hope it helps those who are studying NMF for the first time (*^^)v In the second half, we visualize the learning process.</description>
