      <description># What&#39;s this?  macbook Python environment
 pyenv poetry pipx  It&amp;rsquo;s a memo because it was built in. The environment is mac OS 10.14.6 Mojave. I will proceed with the assumption that homebrew is already included. (If you don&amp;rsquo;t have homebrew, please refer to Homebrew official) I will update it as appropriate.
#Install Python3 Install python3 of system with homebrew. If you have already put it in, please skip it.</description>

      <description>It is as this article that had been a hot topic before. â€¦Because it becomes a worthless article, I will explain it a little.  My Python Development Environment, 2020 Edition
The author of this article uses WSL, but I can use it almost as it is in OS X environment.
pyenv  Why? I need to run multiple Python versions, isolated from the system Python.pyenv makes it easy to install, manage, and switch between those multiple Pythons.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  Create a virtual environment management environment (?) using pyenv and pipenv. The version control of Python itself is done with pyenv, and the virtual environment for each project and package management are done with pipenv.

      <description># Overview  This article is a step-by-step article on how a beginner himself developed a coupon distribution service for iPhone with RESTful API and swift. It was a very detouring implementation because we implemented it while examining the technical elements one by one.
Python is originally installed on the Mac, but the version is old as of OS 10.15. When actually writing Python, everyone seems to have been updated to 3 series.</description>

      <description>## Issue  The following error occurs when you do python -m tkinter or import tkinter with python installed by pyenv. When I read the article on the net, it said that it was cured by brew install tcl-tk, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t work. However, apparently it seems that the recently released pyenv v1.2.14 fixes the compatibility with tcl-tk, and GitHub issue I also wrote a solution, so I will share it.</description>

      <description>It is a supplement of [python environment construction final version](http://qiita.com/y__sama/items/5b62d31cb7e6ed50f02c).  20180312 Addendum It seems that conda activate was adopted in conda 4.4.0 released with 2017-12-20. conda/CHANGELOG.md It seems that source activate is not obsolete at the moment, but conda activate is recommended.
Since docker has become proficient recently (I do not feel stress even in a windows environment through a proxy), the need for sandwiching pyenv has decreased, and I am also moving to docker-anaconda, but for reference.</description>
