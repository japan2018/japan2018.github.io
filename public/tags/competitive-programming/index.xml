      <description>Currently (2020/05/05) using  ** Templates for competitive professionals (for Python) such as AtCoder! ** Please use when it is good~ (I&amp;rsquo;m sorry if I make a mistake!)
#Competitive Pro Template Since I think that I often delete the first line and submit it, sys which is always used (on input) and other libraries Is divided into two lines! Also, sys.stdin.readline().rstrip() is obviously faster than input()! ! ! Reference article [It&amp;rsquo;s good to know Python 8 small differences in processing speed] (https://www.</description>

      <description>I will explain how to solve **A,B,(C),D problem** of **AtCoder Beginners Contest 165** with **Python3** as carefully as possible.  I am aiming to explain a solution method that satisfies the following three points, not just a solution method.
 Simple: don&amp;rsquo;t worry about extra things Easy to implement: I&amp;rsquo;m happy with fewer mistakes and bugs No time required: Paphos go up and more time can be left for D problem  5/17 C Problem was very difficult and the article was long, so I separated it into another article.</description>

      <description># Self-introduction  Hello. I am a third year college student who became a light blue coder the other day. The language is python, started in June of last year (2019). I&amp;rsquo;m not very good at writing, but I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll see it to the end.
Background of starting competitive programming When I entered university, I started studying information systems, I got basic information in October of the same year, applied information in April of the next year, and I was wondering what to study next, but a friend who is not an information system machine learning with python It was ridiculous to discover that I was self-taught.</description>

      <description>Nice to meet you.  I am a beginner who was introduced to competitive professionals last week. I&amp;rsquo;m using python now.
If possible, I want to get good results in competitive professionals without resorting to C++! So I thought about how to increase the score with python.
For example in C++
#define rep(i,n) for((i)=0;(i)&amp;lt;(int)(n);(i)++) There are many people who speed up like this. In short, I feel like simplifying the frequently used descriptions.</description>

      <description>I found an interesting problem, so I tried solving it.  Problem  There are $N$ cards, and the $i$th card has $A_i$ written on it. T picks out $M$ from this at the same time. How many pairs of numbers are there on the removed card? However, it does not distinguish pairs such as $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ whose order is changed. For example, consider the case where $N=5$, $M=2$, $\{A\}=\{1,2,2,3,4\}$.</description>

      <title>[Python] What to use for Python stacks and queues (speed comparison of each data structure)</title>
      <link>https://memotut.com/107c42372/</link>

      <description>#Introduction  This article is primarily about competitive programming.
There are several ways to implement stacks and queues in Python.
 Stack -Use list (append(), pop()) -Use collections.deque (append(), pop()) Queue -Use list (append(), pop(0)) -Use collections.deque (append(), popleft()) -Use queue.Queue (put(), get())  Which of these is the best to use? This time I will investigate it focusing on the speed aspect.
#Measurement method For each data structure, elements are added and extracted 10 times, 100 times, 1000 times, 10000 times, 100000 times.</description>

      <description># About this article  At AtCoderofthecompetitionprogrammingsite,thereis&amp;rdquo;AtCoderProgrammingGuideforbeginners(APG4b)&amp;rdquo; which is an introductory material for programming. There is. C++, which is the mainstream language for competitive programming, is used as an introductory material for programming. So, in this article, I wrote a Python version of APG4b. Basically, please read APG4b, and refer to this article for Python-specific parts.
Most are based on APG4b, so if this article seems to be a problem, remove it immediately.</description>

      <description>#Time required  #Impression The last problem was that experimentation was important or I was aware of the essence, but I could not put the solution into a simpler one.
#A problem
Properly output using the ternary operator.
b=input() print(&amp;#34;A&amp;#34; if b==&amp;#34;T&amp;#34; else &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; if b==&amp;#34;A&amp;#34; else &amp;#34;G&amp;#34; if b==&amp;#34;C&amp;#34; else &amp;#34;C&amp;#34;) #B Problem
If one of the AGCTs comes, add it, and if any other character comes, reset it to zero again.</description>

      <description>Here are two CLI tools to help you solve AtCoder comfortably.  The environment used in this entry is Windows 10, Python 3. Of course, other OS and languages are also supported.
What you can do Create a contest directory 
 acc new {contest ID} A contest directory will be created.  The directory for the contest is cut off for each problem. Under the problem directory, a main.py file that writes the answers and a test file that describes the input and output of the sample case are created.</description>

      <description>#Introduction   Introducing the Python standard library that can be used in competitive programming. It also contains AtCoder problems and code solved using the Python standard library. Python3 version on AtCoder is 3.4.3. I will not explain the problem.  #Standard library
bisect ** Sequence bisection algorithm **
bisect_left(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))
Returns the position where $x$ can be inserted into $a$ for the sorted list $a$. If $a$ contains $x$, the insertion point is before (left) any existing $x$ value.</description>

Concept The problematic $X$, $Y$ constraints are ・$1 \leqq X \leqq 10^6$ ・$1 \leqq Y \leqq 10^6$ Therefore, it is necessary to think that TLE will be used for DP, BFS, and DFS. (Each order will be O(NM).) *By the way, it is said that the limit of the calculation amount of AtCoder is about $1.</description>

      <description>[Tips to know when programming competitively in Python2](http://qiita.com/lethe2211/items/b91cc9e2b355ad32f1e6) is divided into data structures.  The Python version is 2.7.5 (In Python3, specifications such as input/output are very different, so I recommend you to refer to other articles).
int Integer type.
Strictly speaking, Python integers have integer type int and long integer type long.
 Type is automatically converted by boundary value like Ruby&amp;rsquo;s Fixnum and Bignum There is no difference in methods that can be used with integer type and long integer type like BigInteger of Java  So don&amp;rsquo;t worry too much about it.</description>
