<pre><code>[**KPMG Japan Secret Calculator Hackathon**](https://home.kpmg/jp/ja/home/campaigns/2019/07/hackathon-event.html) Results and impressions Report.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This time, one of the co-sponsors, <a href="https://eaglys.co.jp"><strong>EAGLYS Corporation</strong></a>Ijoinedas/)!
Other sponsors were ** National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) **, ** Mitsubishi Estate Co., Ltd. **, ** Eltes Co., Ltd. **.
It was held on November 7th and 8th for two days, and it was very exciting with the participation of many people even though it was held on weekdays! !</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>originally,</p>
<ul>
<li>I want more people to know the calculation method that uses cryptography called secret calculation!</li>
<li>We would like to gather together various people such as business people, engineers, students, etc. to think about the use cases in which secret calculation is useful!</li>
<li>Let the technician write the code that actually uses the secret calculation and feel how the secret calculation is done!</li>
</ul>
<p>This hackathon was held with such a thought.
EAGLYS provided the tutorial code using the open source library, the use case example and its demo code to the first secret computation hackathon in Japan.
If you are interested, please see the demo code on <a href="https://gitlab.com/he-hackathon/he-hackathon-2019"><strong>he-hackathon-2019</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="report-impression">Report (impression)</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to summarize what you enjoyed and what you thought.</p>
<ul>
<li>A total of 25 participants from 6 teams of working people and university students gathered, and each one was a great achievement, such as creating a demo code from a use case. In the presentation of the deliverables presentation, each team had an enthusiastic presentation and questions were asked by the judges, and good discussions were taking place.</li>
<li>KPMG&rsquo;s moderation was interesting, and I was glad to be able to release everyone&rsquo;s tension in a nice way and have a hackathon in a fun atmosphere.</li>
<li>The hospitality of all KPMG staff was great. The hackathon has done a great job of smoothing the preparation of drinks and food, and the progress of the day.</li>
<li>A valuable lecture was given by a homomorphic cryptographer at NICT. I think that it was a very useful lecture for beginners because it was a content that even a person who did not know secret calculation at all could understand, and people with knowledge will have a high level discussion such as a private discussion later. It was very exciting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="result">result</h2>
<p>As a result of the examination,</p>
<ul>
<li>** Winner ** &ldquo;Perform electronic voting using secret calculation&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Mitsubishi Estate Award</strong> &ldquo;Use of secret calculation in anomaly detection using pulse&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Special Award</strong> &ldquo;Perform secret calculation on image features of date matching site&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>The team that created the three ideas and the demo was awarded.
Other teams are also very close, sharing the secret data with the industry and secretly calculating the anomaly detection model, conducting the path diagnosis from the secret performance data, and using the secret calculation when calculating child support. There was a very interesting use case announcement.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I think there were many people who touched secret calculation for the first time, but I think that it was a very fulfilling two days, from the idea to the completeness of the code, I was able to show me the deliverables that I could not think that it was completed in 2 days.
I want to do git management for the artifacts in the same way, and do my best to create a Japanese open community in the secret calculation area where I can scrutinize further and update new code.</p>
<p>Thank you to all the participants and management for 2 days! !</p>
