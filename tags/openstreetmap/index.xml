      <description>This is the 21st day article of [MYJLab Advent Calendar 2019](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2019/myjlab).Thatchwillbeincharge.(Sorryforthedelay)  This time what to do Recently, there is a phenomenon that there is a FamilyMart on the other side of the road across my road. In order to visualize this phenomenon, I would like to drop the increase in the number of FamilyMart stores in the time series heat map for each prefecture.
What to use There is a library called Leaflet that can draw nice maps with JavaScript.</description>

      <description>#I am still dissatisfied with the accuracy of GPS on smartphones  Nowadays you can easily perform GPS logging on your smartphone, After all, there are some errors.
The following is the track of the vehicle traveled by MyTracks (Is it no longer usable?) People can see where they ran, but I can&amp;rsquo;t manage to make a beautiful track&amp;hellip; However, I do not have data such as G sensor and steering, and even if there is it, it seems difficult for an amateur to correct it.</description>
