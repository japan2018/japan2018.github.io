<pre><code># Self-introduction
</code></pre>
<p>Hello. I am a third year college student who became a light blue coder the other day. The language is python, started in June of last year (2019). I&rsquo;m not very good at writing, but I hope you&rsquo;ll see it to the end.</p>
<h1 id="background-of-starting-competitive-programming">Background of starting competitive programming</h1>
<p>When I entered university, I started studying information systems, I got basic information in October of the same year, applied information in April of the next year, and I was wondering what to study next, but a friend who is not an information system machine learning with python It was ridiculous to discover that I was self-taught. I started studying python.
I knew about the python language at the time, but I didn&rsquo;t know any specific grammar, and at school I learned a lesser-known language called Processing, so I remember feeling very impatient. If an undergraduate student who is not an information system student starts programming, their market value will drop! Next, I hurriedly set up an environment and started to study grammar.
However, I could input properly but there was no output scene at all, I tried searching other programming study sites such as Progate, but when I was stepping on what I was doing and there was nothing that fits well, when I was friends on Twitter (Apart from my friend above) skipped the reply, &ldquo;Do you want to do competitive programming?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
But it&rsquo;s definitely funny, I love programming and I love to compete with people. I did a quick search and found AtCoder.
It didn&rsquo;t take time to get into the swamp of competitive programming. It has become a machine that solves problems.
#Knowledge
BFS, DFS, segment tree, DP, binary search, inverse element, UnionFind, Dijkstra, Warshall Floyd, etc. Since I used mathematics for the examination, I have a minimum knowledge. However, to be honest, I think that the knowledge required to become light blue is about binary search, BFS, DFS. After that, you can probably go if you are aware of solving quickly and accurately. This way blue is impossible.</p>
<h1 id="what-i-did-before-becoming-light-blue">What I did before becoming light blue</h1>
<p>In conclusion, I solved the problem. However, I do not think that efforts should always be directed in the wrong direction. Either you get tired or you get results. The more you are passionate about competitive programming, the more you have to think about how to work. There are a few things you need to be aware of when solving problems. In the following, I will make words that I was aware of.</p>
<h2 id="learn-unknown-algorithms-on-the-spot">Learn unknown algorithms on the spot</h2>
<p>Humans can hardly remember what they don&rsquo;t need now. On the other hand, what you need now often comes in smoothly. In other words, I think it&rsquo;s efficient to learn the algorithms you need now. If you have an algorithm that solves a problem and you don&rsquo;t understand it, study the algorithm to solve the problem.
I will read the ant book etc. and learn all the algorithms before I do the competition programming! You probably should quit.</p>
<h2 id="never-implement">Never implement</h2>
<p>After solving a problem, there are some people who move on to the next problem without implementing it because they can do it in their head. Let&rsquo;s definitely stop this too. The first reason is probably not implemented. Many of the problems to skip without implementing are heavy to implement, and probably hard to implement until the end without bugs.
Second is inefficiency. There are two phases to solve the problem, the first is the consideration. There is a phase to consider what kind of algorithm and data structure can be used to solve this problem, and a second phase is to actually drop it into the code. It&rsquo;s an experience, but there are many people around me who can do the first phase but not the second phase. In other words, many people lack practice in that area. Let&rsquo;s implement it. We&rsquo;re not doing a competition review contest.</p>
<h2 id="solve-similar-problems">Solve similar problems</h2>
<p>As with anything, if you can&rsquo;t do BFS, you can&rsquo;t do it without solving the problems of BFS and DP if you can&rsquo;t do DP. That&rsquo;s obvious.
Fortunately, the problem has an explanation, so it should contain the knowledge you need to solve the problem. Let&rsquo;s solve the problem that I could not do.</p>
<h2 id="important-to-escape">Important to escape</h2>
<p>If you have a problem that you do not understand even after reading the explanation, let&rsquo;s escape. As I wrote earlier, I&rsquo;m tired of getting the results first. Even if you can understand the problem that you can not understand even if you read the explanation, I think that it will be possible to solve it during the contest as early as one month or three months. If so, it&rsquo;s definitely quicker to get results when you make sure that you read, understand, and implement issues that you can implement. There are words that I cherish in myself, and in the words of Daigo Umehara, a professional gamer, there is a word that says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not tired of the game, I&rsquo;m tired of not growing.&rdquo; First of all, let&rsquo;s give top priority to being able to feel the growth yourself.</p>
<h2 id="enter-the-contest">Enter the contest</h2>
<p>Can you concentrate on studying for 100 minutes from now? I think there are quite a few people who can answer YES when asked. But what about? I think your nerves have been sharpened when you entered the contest. Isn&rsquo;t it so concentrated that you can&rsquo;t? I study this density every week and the rate shouldn&rsquo;t go up.
Also, I feel a lot of regret about the problems I could not solve during the contest. It&rsquo;s highly recommended because you can solve problems with a different motivation than when you normally solve problems.</p>
<h2 id="lets-make-people-who-can-compete-closely">Let&rsquo;s make people who can compete closely</h2>
<p>In my case, I was a senior and a professor, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter if I don&rsquo;t want to lose to my friends or my juniors. Competitive programming with someone is a lot of fun, and regretful feelings when you lose are important.</p>
<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time, but thank you for reading. I would definitely recommend using AtCoder when working in a new language. (I didn&rsquo;t get any money from AtCoder)</p>
