<pre><code>#Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>Data science and machine learning are fun! However, do you have the experience that you don&rsquo;t know how to study?
By the way, I am one of them.
In this article, *** What is machine learning in the first place? Even if you are a beginner who knows the word AI but do not know the details, you will learn the learning method *** to learn from the basic foundations necessary to gain knowledge and experience and be able to tackle machine learning. I will introduce it based on my experience! (I think that what is introduced here can also be used as a review of basic knowledge by those who are intermediate or above in machine learning)</p>
<p>#Outline (Basically these 3 steps)</p>
<ol>
<li>Basic knowledge (understanding of words and terms)</li>
<li>Understand how to use the library</li>
<li>Actually challenge the competition (<a href="Whatis#kaggle">Kaggle</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>#1. A textbook that clearly understands the mechanism and technology of machine learning &amp; deep learning in this one book

<p>In the case of a field that you are learning for the first time, the first problem that comes up is that you don&rsquo;t understand Japanese (I don&rsquo;t understand technical terms). I think this is common to all disciplines, but I think it is especially true for machine learning.
This book is recommended for overcoming such situations, and it is just a &ldquo;textbook&rdquo; that teaches you from the basics.</p>
<h2 id="brief-introduction">Brief introduction</h2>
<p>Chapter 1: Basic knowledge of artificial intelligence
(AI, machine learning, deep learning, historical background, etc. have a good basic knowledge that you should first harden)
Chapters 2-4: About Machine Learning
(Explains from basic knowledge that often appears when looking at machine learning documents to algorithms)
Chapters 5-7: About Deep Learning
(Explain the process and algorithm from the basic knowledge of deep learning)
Chapter 8: System Environment and Development Environment
(Description of machine learning library and framework, deep learning framework from the point of selecting programming language)</p>
<ul>
<li>Personally, it was easy to understand that the flow of machine learning on p214 and the diagram that summarizes the library are easy to understand, and that it is done in this way.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recommended-reading">Recommended reading</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First of all, read it (try to read it even if you don&rsquo;t understand some words)
→ Even if you do this, when you look at other articles and literature, it will be easier to learn because it starts from the word you have seen, not the word you do not understand!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focusing on rereading the part where the basic knowledge is written + the final chapter that shows the flow of development
(In terms of chapters, chapters 1, 2, 5, 8)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After reading to some extent, proceed to the next step and use this book as a reference book to look up when you come across an unknown word.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>#2. <a href="https://datawokagaku.com/python_for_ds_summary/">Introduction to Python for Data Science</a>
Kame@US Data Scientist&rsquo;s blog
<a href="https://gyazo.com/abe82784f9c8e1b372b1684254457e08"><img src="https://gyazo.com/abe82784f9c8e1b372b1684254457e08/raw" alt="Screenshot from Gyazo"></a>
Kame-san&rsquo;s blog itself has a lot to learn, so it&rsquo;s a good idea to find a time to read it, but this course is especially recommended. It is very easy to understand because a good library that can be said to be used when doing machine learning is systematically organized. (I think the Kaggle Start Book I&rsquo;ll show you later will be better understood after you read this article.)</p>
<h2 id="brief-introduction-1">Brief introduction</h2>
<p>(For the introduction of this content, since the &ldquo;purpose of this course&rdquo; part written on the blog was easy to understand, I will quote from that part)
This course aims to master the&rsquo;basic&rsquo; usage of Python modules that are frequently used in data science, such as the environment construction necessary for doing data science in Python, the basics of Python, the basics of the Python library used for data science, and other is.</p>
<p>The aim of this course is</p>
<p>Master the basics of using tools, libraries, and modules to process data required for data science in Python
Data can be processed without using a spreadsheet tool such as Excel
Can process data files such as image files
Daily data processing (such as Excel) can be automated with Python
Such a place. Although some statistics are mentioned, please note that it is not a &ldquo;learning data science course&rdquo; but a &ldquo;learning Python for data science&rdquo; course.</p>
<p>However, since there are plenty of &ldquo;techniques that can be used in the field&rdquo; and &ldquo;frequently used data science techniques&rdquo; throughout the course, you can study data science in a broad sense.</p>
<p>Anyway, I intend to write it in a way that is easy to understand. I don&rsquo;t think many difficult words come out, and I&rsquo;m pretty clumsy to explain them, so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll stop there.</p>
<p>Also, instead of teaching in textbooks, &ldquo;how to actually use in the field&rdquo; is included everywhere. Therefore, it is &ldquo;a systematically comprehensive and practically usable content&rdquo;.
(Quoted so far)</p>
<p>As for what is introduced,</p>
<ul>
<li>python basics</li>
<li>NumPy (used for numerical calculation)</li>
<li>Pandas (for manipulating and analyzing data (makes spreadsheets faster than you can in Excel))</li>
<li>matplotlib (for graph drawing)</li>
<li>Seaborn (like matplotlib, you can write graphs, but it&rsquo;s easier and cleaner)</li>
<li>Other useful libraries, modules, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recommended-reading-1">Recommended reading</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First of all, read through (Iron rules!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This may be done at the same time as 1, but move your hands to learn the execution results and movements. (I think there are many things that you can not learn just by reading)
→ The <a href="whatis#kaggle">Kaggle</a> competition called titanic, which is taken up here as a subject, is also used as a tutorial for the Kaggle start book to be introduced later, so I think that it will be more understandable if it can be done together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat reading + read back occasionally</p>
</li>
</ol>

Introduction to Titanic beyond 10 Kernel ~</a> and two authors of <a href="https://note.com/currypurin/n/nf390914c721e">kaggle tutorial</a> <a href="Whatis#kaggle">Kaggle</a> is a tutorial book that I wrote and assembled (the two original books are both popular and easy-to-understand books (articles!))</p>
<p>In the two steps I&rsquo;ve introduced so far, the practice part is a little small, but I think that there are many things you can gain by learning while actually using it. However, the truth is that you don&rsquo;t know where to start. Under such circumstances, joining the book &ldquo;Titanic&rdquo; competition, which is a tutorial for beginners of <a href="Whatis#kaggle">Kaggle</a>, is a good first step!</p>
<h2 id="brief-introduction-2">Brief introduction</h2>
<p>Chapter 1: What is Kaggle? To explain how to create an account (ideal for introduction)
Chapter 2: Titanic Tutorial
Chapter 3: How to handle multiple tables and image/text data
(It has also been introduced to competitions in formats other than the titanic competition tested in Chapter 2.)
Chapter 4: Pages with Tips for Further Learning
(Do not finish just by doing the tutorial. There is content that will be connected to the future)</p>
<h3 id="recommended-points--sample-code">Recommended points ➀: Sample code</h3>
<p>Since the sample code has been completed, if you follow it, you need to register for Kaggle account, but you can also practice the whole process with almost non-coding. (I don&rsquo;t know the details, but if you want to get an overview, you may try running it once and interpreting the code.)</p>
<h3 id="recommended-points--dialogue-article">Recommended points ➁: Dialogue article</h3>
<p>In the page where the two authors have summarized in a dialogue format, I read not only the parts and views that advanced people take for granted, but also the triggers and good things that started Kaggle, and there are many useful things for learning Will also be.</p>
<h3 id="recommended-points--note">Recommended points ➂ :note</h3>
<p>It is easy to understand because the peripheral knowledge of Kaggle and the knowledge of +α are summarized in a column format. (It may come out if you look it up yourself, but since it is organized in an easy-to-understand manner, I am thankful for beginners)</p>
<h2 id="recommended-reading-2">Recommended reading</h2>
<p>(There are some parts that I haven&rsquo;t done yet, so this is my current study plan.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Read Chapter 1 to get an overview of Kaggle and its image2.2 Trying to practice titanic while reading Chapter 2
3.3 Read Chapter 3
(Read the contents of multiple tables, images and text competitions, and read it again when practicing the subject)</li>
<li>Actually participate in the competition.
There is a page (Chapter 4) that introduces how to choose the competition to participate after Titanic and how to fight for beginners, so it is good to participate according to it!</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://qiita.com/rinn650/items/51ed74616ac42b708264">I tried to organize Kaggle&rsquo;s Competitions Categories</a>
← The categories of Kaggle competitions are clearly written!</p>
<p>What is #Kaggle
Kaggle is the world&rsquo;s largest data science community with powerful tools and resources to help you achieve your data science goals.

↑ There was a page in the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/HaradaKei/devsumi-2018summer">Devsumi 2018 summer</a> document by Mr. Harada of DeNA because it was intuitive and easy to understand what Kaggle was. , Quoted.
#4. Summary
I myself have a short history of machine learning, and I think that I am a beginner, but thanks to the environment and teaching materials, I am gradually becoming familiar with it. So, in this article, I hope that it will be useful for those who are interested in machine learning but do not know how to study by themselves by summarizing the basic learning method.
While studying for myself, I wonder if it would be better to do this, and that other people (advanced and intermediate) might be able to study a little more easily. If so, I would like to be able to update it or compile it in another article at any time!</p>
<p>By the way, as for the continuation of the 3 steps I wrote in this article (though it may be a content similar to the practice of the competition of 3), I think that you can further improve your skills if you can refer to the following articles etc.
