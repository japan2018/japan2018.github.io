      <description>#Introduction  February 13 Kyoto University has released Python lecture materials free of charge. Relation: Lecture Material Repository Introduction article-Qiita Introduction article-CodeZine
The content is quite fulfilling. (Not perfect&amp;hellip;) It seems that learning at home will be the key for the future, partly because of COVID-19, so let&amp;rsquo;s make effective use of it. I myself use the basics of Python obscurely, so I would like to take this opportunity to fully understand it.</description>

      <description>## Overview  When executing a tool made with python, it is okay to call it from the command line if it is made by myself, but for tools used by people who are not related to development, it is better to be able to operate from the screen It is convenient. I investigated various ways to make an application with python and summarized the contents made. It&amp;rsquo;s still not very well made, so I plan to gradually adjust it.</description>

      <description>2018 was a shock to me. I used to play around with [Kivy][kivy] of GUI Framekwork, but I found that using a generator can make ugly code full of callback functions surprisingly readable. Then, while trying various things, I became able to understand async/await asynchronous processing, which was a magic that was unfamiliar to me until then, and I was able to create a little asynchronous processing library. In this article   The process until I realized the wonderfulness of the generator and the native coroutine born from it How to implement async/await with Kivy and tkinter using it  I want to write it down.</description>

      <description>#Introduction  It is @seigo2016 of 1st year N high school programming class. It will be N high ad curry day 8. I was worried about what to write because it was a neat article, but I talked a lot about the current main project &amp;ldquo;Itokake Mandala Color Simulator&amp;rdquo; at U22 etc. So, this time I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the recent short-term project &amp;ldquo;PSS ~ Presentation Support System~&amp;rdquo;.
Purpose of # PSS ~Presentation Support System~ I think that you often give presentations using PowerPoint, Google Slide, etc.</description>

      <description># Made  *The video is double speed. I made a game in Python that connects electric paths and lights a Christmas tree light bulb. GUI uses Tkinter. The original story is a game that appeared on NORAD&amp;rsquo;s Santa tracking website a few years ago. Remembering that I loved it all the time, I decided to make it with Python, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying and can use nowadays.
#Environment
Python 3.</description>

      <title>[Python] How to use tkinter in pyenv python</title>
      <link>https://memotut.com/how-to-use-tkinter-in-pyenv-python-a5f83/</link>

      <description>## Issue  The following error occurs when you do python -m tkinter or import tkinter with python installed by pyenv. When I read the article on the net, it said that it was cured by brew install tcl-tk, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t work. However, apparently it seems that the recently released pyenv v1.2.14 fixes the compatibility with tcl-tk, and GitHub issue I also wrote a solution, so I will share it.</description>
