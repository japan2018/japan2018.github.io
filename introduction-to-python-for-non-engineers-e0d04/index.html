<pre><code>## Following the trend of the world ~ About programming ~
</code></pre>
<p>Recently, &ldquo;programming&rdquo; has come to the forefront without even saying. Until a while ago (2010-2015), programming was something that engineers in the science field worked on, and it was unfamiliar to so-called non-mathematical people, such as those used by PC experts.
However, if you look around the world, IT companies such as GAFA are listed in <a href="https://www.180.co.jp/world_etf_adr/adr/ranking.htm">Top 10 in the world market capitalization ranking</a>. However, the impact of IT companies on society is increasing daily in both the US and Asia. I don&rsquo;t think the fact that companies with technology are strong is beyond discussion.
Then, whether it is unnecessary for IT-related knowledge at companies other than IT-related manufacturers and trading companies, and companies that mainly focus on fields such as agriculture and logistics does not mean that at all. <b>If you want to survive, IT knowledge is absolutely necessary. </b>
Nearly 30 years ago, the Internet was certainly not in widespread use, and people&rsquo;s ways of life were completely different, so it might have been better if experts were doing technical things. However, with the passage of time and the spread of mobile phones and the Internet, it has become a world where you can get all of food, clothing and shelter without leaving your home.
<b>Using an Android or Apple smartphone, search on Google, buy what you need for life on Amazon, know the status of your friends on Facebook and Instagram, kill time on Youtube, or call yourself to follow You don&rsquo;t have to go out anymore if you collect and send money with Paypal. </b>
To that extent, the lifestyle has changed due to the development of IT technology (the above examples are extreme). The reason why IT human resources are necessary is that they can contribute to the above lifestyle. Human resources with technology have a high market value and will continue to be needed in the future. Then, what exactly is that technology is programming technology. Just remember that it&rsquo;s a skill that lets you write code, assemble algorithms, implement your own programs, and can bring technical improvements and innovations to your business.
By the way, there is a <b>“Excel master”</b> commonly used to say that it excels in IT technology, but I think it is better not to recognize that Excel can be done = IT human resources. .. You can use it as it is by combining functions and devising spreadsheets, but there are limits to using Excel alone. This was a catalyst for me to learn Python, so I hope people who have similar feelings will consider it as their own.</p>
<h2 id="why-python-instead-of-c-or-java">Why Python instead of C or Java</h2>
<p>I think that many people often wonder, &ldquo;Which language should I start?&rdquo; when starting programming.
In fact, when I was able to use VBA all the time and still thought that I had to learn another language because it was not enough for what I wanted to do, I was at a loss as to which language to choose.
Ruby, PHP, Java, C (C++), Perl&hellip; Looking around the world, there are many programming languages, and there are even legacy languages such as COBOL, BASIC, and FORTRAN. By the way, it is a rumor that the blue bank in the mega bank, which is often talked about, is still using COBOL, but in reality it is&hellip;
Anyway, it&rsquo;s no exaggeration to say that which language you choose affects your subsequent programming life. Because it influences your writing habits, what you can do, and whether you like it intuitively or not, so in that sense it&rsquo;s a lot like being influenced by your first girlfriend. If you associate with an eccentric person, you will like the eccentric person somehow after that, or you will somehow choose the same type as the ex-boyfriend Kano&hellip;I think that you can understand the importance of choosing a bit.</p>
<p>Personally speaking, the first programming language I touched was Java, which I learned in college electives, which was a very bad experience. This is because, regardless of whether the instructor knows this or not, the curriculum will be followed and the question, &ldquo;Why do you write this way and how does it work?&rdquo; goes on without being resolved. It&rsquo;s like going on to somewhere in junior high school or high school without knowing why the math formula is &ldquo;why this will happen&rdquo;.
Thanks to that, I couldn&rsquo;t follow the lesson completely and abandoned the lesson, and I couldn&rsquo;t understand the basics, so programming wasn&rsquo;t suitable for me and I couldn&rsquo;t do it. is there. I don&rsquo;t want anyone reading this to have that kind of experience, so I recommend the language &ldquo;Python&rdquo;.
<b><a href="http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html">This site</a></b> ranks programming languages based on the number of tutorials checked by Google, but here Python comes out the highest. The second is Java and the third is Javascript, but I feel that it&rsquo;s definitely that kind of feeling from the skin&rsquo;s perspective.
In addition, Python boasts a considerable number in terms of income and offers as shown in the figure below, demonstrating that the world is heading to data science.
<img src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/442382/8fb5b0cb-2997-6ca4-51d1-19b0d156d953.png" alt="image.png">
Python is a language that is so popular and can be expected to generate income, but in fact, learning costs are much lower than Java and C, and the advantage of being easy to write even by non-programmers is personally the best thing. As I mentioned above, Python has become a memorable experience for me who has fallen out of programming in Java, and made me realize that the world of programming is not far away.
This is the reason why I want to recommend Python.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-so-easy--how-to-write-python">Is it so easy! ? How to write Python</h2>
<p>Some people may think, &ldquo;That said, Python is a programming language, so you often learn it, right?&rdquo; Certainly, there are a certain number of things to learn because it&rsquo;s a programming language, but Python is still super easy to get started with.
First, try downloading Python on the official website.
<a href="https://www.python.jp/">https://www.python.jp/</a>
On the above site, click &ldquo;Download&rdquo; Python 3.7.2 to install it. For a detailed explanation of here, please googling with &ldquo;Python installation method&rdquo;.
Anyway, if you can install Python, please start the following program</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python:hello.py" data-lang="python:hello.py"><span style="color:#66d9ef">print</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;Hello World!&#39;</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Yes, the output is already &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo;. Python has the advantage of outputting Hello World at the ultimate speed.
By the way, many programming languages require some type of output or variables to be &ldquo;typed&rdquo;, but the nice thing about Python is that it types arbitrarily (good or bad).
For good or bad, suppose you wrote the following code in Python.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python:sample.py" data-lang="python:sample.py">a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>
b <span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;hello&#39;</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">print</span>(a)
<span style="color:#66d9ef">print</span>(b)
<span style="color:#75715e">#2</span>
<span style="color:#75715e">#hello</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The number 2 is assigned to a, and the character string hello is assigned to b.
This is not a mistake by itself, so if you print each with a print statement, it will output what you put in a variable properly. And since the contents of the variable are judged to be numeric type (int type) and string type (str type), it is not necessary to declare them like other languages, but this is the cause. There are times when bugs occur, so I want you to gradually remember it and feel that &ldquo;Oh, Python has some weak points.&rdquo;
Anyway, even from a point like this, even non-programmers can do programming tricks suddenly, so it&rsquo;s very fun, and I recommend it because it gives you a versatility like &ldquo;I SUGEEEE&rdquo;.
By the way, I found the following code as the code that shows the most fun of programming.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python:for_py" data-lang="python:for_py">for i in range(11):
    print(i)
#0
#1
#2
#3
#Four
#Five
#6
#7
#8
#9
#Ten
</code></pre><p>It is an excellent product that repeatedly displays numbers up to 10 in an instant.
I want you to google it like a Python for statement.</p>
<p>##Python I know you&rsquo;re good, but what can you do?
Up to this point, Python has been written as if it were a universal language, but what you can actually do with Python is as follows.
・Web production (framework is complete)
・Machine learning
・Internet scraping (so-called, regularly picking up certain information from a certain site)
・Data analysis (same system as Excel, but can be processed more mathematically)</p>
<p>The opposite is that
<b>-Creating a dynamic mechanism for websites such as Javascript</p>
<ul>
<li>Things like blogs and applications can be created with Flask or Django, but you shouldn&rsquo;t expect a framework like the artist&rsquo;s HP</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A program that can be run in any environment if compiled like Java</b>
It&rsquo;s about&hellip; There are various things to do after all, but it is a good point of Python that you can do pretty much anything.
Machine learning is probably the biggest advantage. In the coming era, I&rsquo;ve heard that data science has managed to be ears, but I can&rsquo;t separate it even if Python&rsquo;s existence is cut off. Of course, it comes out when statistically processing R and SPSS and so on, but when you look at Twitter, the trend of the world including the United States is being processed by Python &hellip;
In today&rsquo;s world, Python is just as good as it can be, but it doesn&rsquo;t really become a magic wand like &ldquo;Sure! Adopt! Annual income of 10 million!&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll just say that I think I will.
I hope you&rsquo;ve read this article even a little and got interested in Python and challenged it.</li>
