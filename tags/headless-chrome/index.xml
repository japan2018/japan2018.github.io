      <description>#Purpose  Actually, I was secretly automating part of the internal work, but I suddenly looked into the server log and thought that it would be obvious that it was automated, so I verified it.
Verification environment  Use PaizaCloud as a web server Use Selenium-webdriver and headless-chrome as an automatic access method Use Python as a program to automate  What you did Introducing Selenium and Headless Chrome There are many articles about this, so I will omit it.</description>
